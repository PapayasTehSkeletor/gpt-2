DA
CHAPTER—Nearly
HISTORICAL D
40 years after Christ predicted these events, in A.D. 66, the Jews
rebelled against the Roman Empire. Cestus withdrew his troops in
October A.D 67. On May 10, A.D. 70, Titus besieged the city, and it
fell in August. See pages 26-27 for a map and description of this
remarkable battle.
Places named in chapters 1 through 5 are listed on the first two
maps on pages 440-441. Those mentioned in chapters 6 through 11
will be found on the last two (pp. 442-443) of those four map pages.

The

Controversy

Fair and peaceful is the scene spread out before Him. In
the midst of gardens and vineyards and green slopes studded
with pilgrims’ tents, rise the terraced hills, the stately palaces, and massive bulwarks of Israel’s capital. The daughter
of Zion seems in her pride to say, “I sit a queen, and shall see
no sorrow;” as lovely now, and deeming herself as secure in
Heaven’s favor, as when, ages before, the royal minstrel sung,
“Beautiful for situation, the joy of the whole earth, is Mount
Zion,” “the city of the great King.” Psalm 48:2. In full view
are the magnificent buildings of the temple. The rays of the
setting sun light up the snowy whiteness of its marble walls,
and gleam from golden gate and tower and pinnacle. “The
perfection of beauty” it stands, the pride of the Jewish nation. What child of Israel could gaze upon the scene without
a thrill of joy and admiration! But far other thoughts occupy
the mind of Jesus. “When he was come near, He beheld the
city, and wept over it.” Luke 19:41. Amid the universal rejoicing of the triumphal entry, while palm branches wave,
while glad hosannas awake the echoes of the hills, and thousands of voices declare Him king, the world’s Redeemer is
overwhelmed with a sudden and mysterious sorrow. He, the
Son of God, the Promised One of Israel, whose power has
conquered death, and called its captives from the grave, is in
tears, not of ordinary grief, but of intense, irrepressible agony.
His tears were not for Himself, though He well knew
whither His feet were tending. Before Him lay Gethsemane. Not far distant was the place of crucifixion. Upon the
path which He was soon to tread must fall the horror of great
darkness as He should make His soul an offering for sin. Yet
it was not a contemplation of these scenes that cast the
shadow upon Him in this hour of gladness. No forebodings
of His own superhuman anguish clouded that unselfish spirit.
He wept for the doomed thousands of Jerusalem,—because
of the blindness and impenitence of those whom He came to
bless and save.
The history of a thousand years of privilege and blessing, granted to the Jewish people, was unfolded to the
eye of Jesus. The Lord had made Zion His holy habitation.

There prophets had unsealed their rolls and uttered their warnings. There priests had waved their censers, and daily offered the blood of slain lambs, pointing forward to the Lamb
of God. There had Jehovah dwelt in visible glory, in the
shekinah above the mercy-seat. There rested the base of that
mystic ladder connecting earth with Heaven,—that ladder
upon which angels of God descended and ascended, and
which opened to the world the way into the holiest of all.
Had Israel as a nation preserved her allegiance to Heaven,
Jerusalem would have stood forever, the elect metropolis of
God. But the history of that favored people was a record of
backsliding and rebellion. They had resisted Heaven’s grace,
abused their privileges, slighted their opportunities.
Amid forgetfulness and apostasy, God had dealt with
Israel as a loving father deals with a rebellious son, admonishing, warning, correcting, still saying in the tender
anguish of a parent’s soul, How can I give thee up? When
remonstrance, entreaty, and rebuke had failed, God sent to
His people the best gift of Heaven; nay, He poured out to
them all Heaven in that one gift.
For three years the Son of God knocked at the gate of
the impenitent city. He came to His vineyard seeking fruit.
Israel had been as a vine transplanted from Egypt into a genial soil. He dug about His vine; He pruned and cherished it.
He was unwearied in His efforts to save this vine of His own
planting. For three years the Lord of light and glory had gone
in and out among His people. He healed the sick; He comforted the sorrowing; He raised the dead; He spoke pardon
and peace to the repentant. He gathered about Him the weak
and the weary, the helpless and the desponding, and extended
to all, without respect to age or character, the invitation of
mercy: “Come unto Me, all ye that labor and are heavy-laden,
and I will give you rest.” Matthew 11:28.
Regardless of indifference and contempt, He had
steadfastly pursued His ministry of love. No frown upon
His brow repelled the suppliant. Himself subjected to privation and reproach, He had lived to scatter blessings in His
path, to plead with men to accept the gift of life. The waves

12

The

Great

Controversy

of mercy, beaten back by the stubborn heart, returned in a
tide of untiring love. But Israel had turned from her best
friend and only helper. The pleadings of His love had been
despised, His counsels spurned, His warnings ridiculed.
The hour of grace and reprieve was fast passing; the
cup of God’s long-deferred wrath was almost full. The
cloud of wrath that had been gathering through ages of apostasy and rebellion, was about to burst upon a guilty people,
and He who alone could save them from their impending
fate had been slighted, abused, rejected, and was soon to be
crucified. When Christ should hang on Calvary’s cross,
Israel’s day as a nation favored and blessed of God would be
ended. The loss of even one soul is a calamity in comparison
with which the gain of a world sinks into insignificance; but
as Christ looked upon Jerusalem, the doom of a whole city, a
whole nation, was before Him; that city, that nation which
had once been the chosen of God,—His peculiar treasure.
Prophets had wept over the apostasy of Israel. Jeremiah wished that his eyes were a fountain of tears, that he
might “weep day and night for the slain of the daughter of
his people.” What, then, was the grief of Him whose prophetic glance took in, not years, but ages? He beholds the
destroying angel hovering over the ancient metropolis of patriarchs and prophets. From the ridge of Olivet, the very spot
afterward occupied by Titus and his army, He looks across
the valley upon the sacred courts and porticoes, and with
tear-blinded eyes He sees, in awful perspective, the walls
surrounded by alien armies. He hears the tread of the hosts
mustering for battle. He hears the voice of mothers and children crying for bread in the besieged city. He sees her holy
and beautiful house, her palaces and towers, given to the
flames, and where once they stood, only a heap of smouldering ruins.
He looks down the ages, and sees the covenant people
scattered in every land, like wrecks on a dessert shore.
He sees in the temporal retribution about to fall upon her
children, but the first draught from that cup of wrath which
at the final Judgment she must drain to its dregs. Divine pity,

yearning love, finds utterance in the mournful words: “O
Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the prophets, and
stonest them which are sent unto thee, how often would I
have gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth
her chickens under her wings, and ye would not!” Matthew
23:37. Oh that thou, a nation favored above every other, hadst
known the time of thy visitation, and the things that belong
unto thy peace! I have stayed the angel of justice, I have
called thee to repentance, but all in vain. It is not merely
servants, delegates, and prophets, whom thou hast refused
and rejected, but the Holy One of Israel, thy Redeemer. If
thou art destroyed, thou art alone responsible. “Ye will not
come to Me that ye might have life.”
Christ saw in Jerusalem a symbol of a world hardened in unbelief and rebellion, and rushing on to meet
the retributive judgments of God. The woes of a fallen
race, pressing upon His soul, forced from His lips that exceeding bitter cry. He saw the record of sin traced in human
misery, in tears and blood; his heart was moved with infinite
pity for the afflicted and suffering ones of earth; He yearned
to relieve all. But He knew that even His hand might not turn
back the incoming tide of human woe; few would seek their
only source of help. He was willing to suffer and to die to
bring salvation within their reach; but few would come to
Him that they might have life.
The Majesty of Heaven in tears! the Son of the infinite
God troubled in spirit, bowed down with anguish! The scene
filled all Heaven with wonder. That scene reveals to us the
exceeding sinfulness of sin; it shows how hard a task it is,
even for infinite power, to save the guilty from the consequences of transgressing the law of God. Jesus, looking down
to the last generation, saw the world inclosed in a deception
similar to that which caused the destruction of Jerusalem.
The great sin of the Jews was their rejection of Christ; the
great sin of the Christian world would be their rejection of
the law of God, the foundation of His government in Heaven
and earth. The precepts of Jehovah would be despised and
set at naught. Millions in bondage to sin, slaves of Satan,

14

The

Great

Controversy

doomed to suffer the second death, would refuse to listen to
the words of truth in their day of visitation. Terrible blindness! strange infatuation!
Two days before the passover, when Christ had for the
last time departed from the temple, after denouncing the hypocrisy of the Jewish rulers, He again went out with His
disciples to the Mount of Olives, and seated Himself with
them upon a grassy slope overlooking the city. Once more
He gazed upon its walls, its towers and palaces. Once more
He beheld the temple in its dazzling splendor, a diadem of
beauty crowning the sacred mount.
A thousand years before had the psalmist magnified God’s
favor to Israel in making her holy house His dwelling-place:
“In Salem also is His tabernacle, and His dwelling-place in
Zion.” Psalm 76:2. “He chose the tribe of Judah, the Mount
Zion which He loved. And He built His sanctuary like high
palaces.” Psalm 78:68, 69. The first temple had been erected
during the most prosperous period of Israel’s history. Vast
stores of treasure for this purpose had been collected by King
David, and the plans for its construction were made by divine inspiration. Solomon, the wisest of Israel’s monarchs,
had completed the work. This temple was the most magnificent building which the world ever saw. Yet the Lord
had declared by the prophet Haggai, concerning the second temple, “The glory of this latter house shall be
greater than of the former.” “I will shake all nations, and
the Desire of all nations shall come, and I will fill this house
with glory, saith the Lord of hosts.” Haggai 2:9, 7.
After the destruction of the temple by Nebuchadnezzar, it
was rebuilt about five hundred years before the birth of Christ,
by a people who from a lifelong captivity had returned to a
wasted and almost deserted country. There were then among
them aged men who had seen the glory of Solomon’s temple,
and who wept at the foundation of the new building, that it
must be so inferior to the former. The feeling that prevailed
is forcibly described by the prophet: “Who is left among you
that saw this house in her first glory? and how do ye see it
now? is it not in your eyes in comparison of it as nothing?”

The

of

Jerusalem

[22-24]

1 5

Haggai 2:3. Then was given the promise that the glory of
this latter house should be greater than of the former.
But the second temple had not equaled the first in magnificence; nor was it hallowed by those visible tokens of the
divine presence which pertained to the first temple. There
was no manifestation of supernatural power to mark its dedication. No cloud of glory was seen to fill the newly erected
sanctuary. No fire from Heaven descended to consume the
sacrifice upon its altar. The shekinah no longer abode between the cherubim in the most holy place; the ark, the mercyseat, and the tables of the testimony were not to be found
therein. No voice sounded from Heaven to make known to
the inquiring priest the will of Jehovah.
For centuries the Jews had vainly endeavored to show
wherein the promise of God, given by Haggai, had been fulfilled; yet pride and unbelief blinded their minds to the true
meaning of the prophet’s words. The second temple was not
honored with the cloud of Jehovah’s glory, but with the living presence of One in whom dwelt the fullness of the
Godhead bodily,—who was God Himself manifest in the
flesh. The “Desire of all nations” had indeed come to His
temple when the Man of Nazareth taught and healed in the
sacred courts. In the presence of Christ, and in this only, did
the second temple exceed the first in glory. But Israel had
put from her the proffered gift of Heaven. With the humble
Teacher who had that day passed out from its golden gate,
the glory had forever departed from the temple. Already were
fulfilled the Saviour’s words, “Your house is left unto you
desolate.” Matthew 23:38.
The disciples had been filled with awe and wonder at
Christ’s prediction of the overthrow of the temple, and
they desired to understand more fully the meaning of
His words. Wealth, labor, and architectural skill had for more
than forty years been freely expended to enhance its splendors. Herod the Great had lavished upon it both Roman
wealth and Jewish treasure, and even the emperor of the world
had enriched it with his gifts. Massive blocks of white marble,
of almost fabulous size, forwarded from Rome for this pur-

16

The

Great

Controversy

pose, formed a part of its structure; and to these the disciples had called the attention of their Master, saying, “See
what manner of stones and what buildings are here!” Mark
13:1.
To these words, Jesus made the solemn and starting
reply, “Verily I say unto you, There shall not be left here
one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down.”
Matthew 24:2.
With the overthrow of Jerusalem the disciples associated
the events of Christ’s personal coming in temporal glory to
take the throne of universal empire, to punish the impenitent
Jews, and to break from off the nation the Roman yoke. The
Lord had told them that He would come the second time.
Hence at the mention of judgments upon Jerusalem, their
minds revert to that coming, and as they are gathered about
the Saviour upon the Mount of Olives, they ask, “When shall
these things be? and what shall be the sign of Thy coming,
and of the end of the world?” Matthew 24:3.
The future was mercifully veiled from the disciples. Had
they at that time fully comprehended the two awful facts,—
the Redeemer’s sufferings and death and the destruction of
their city and temple,—they would have been paralyzed with
horror. Christ presented before them an outline of the prominent events to transpire before the close of time. His words
were not then fully understood; but their meaning was to be
unfolded as His people should need the instruction therein
given. The prophecy which He uttered was twofold in its
meaning: while foreshadowing the destruction of Jerusalem,
it prefigured also the terrors of the last great day.
Jesus declared to the listening disciples the judgments
that were to fall upon apostate Israel, and especially the
retributive vengeance that would come upon them for
their rejection and crucifixion of the Messiah. Unmistakable signs would precede the awful climax. The
dreaded hour would come suddenly and swiftly. And the
Saviour warned His followers: “When ye therefore shall see
the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the
prophet, stand in the holy place (whoso readeth let him un-

The

Destruction

of

Jerusalem

[25-27]

1 7

derstand), then let them which be in Judea flee into the mountains.” Matthew 24:15, 16. When the idolatrous standards
of the Romans should be set up in the holy ground, which
extended some furlongs outside the city walls, then the followers of Christ were to find safety in flight. When the warning sign should be seen, judgment was to follow so quickly
that those who would escape must make no delay. He who
chanced to be upon the housetop must not go down through
his house into the street; but he must speed his way from
roof to roof until he reach the city wall, and be saved “so as
by fire.” Those who were working in the fields or vineyards must not take time to return for the outer garment laid aside while they should be toiling in the heat of
the day. They must not hesitate a moment, lest they be
involved in the general destruction.
In the reign of Herod, Jerusalem had not only been greatly
beautified, but by the erection of towers, walls, and fortresses,
added to the natural strength of its situation, it had been rendered apparently impregnable. He who would at this time
have foretold publicly its destruction, would, like Noah in
his day, have been called a crazed alarmist. But Christ had
said, “Heaven and earth shall pass away, but My words shall
not pass away.” Matthew 24:35. Because of her sins, wrath
had been denounced against Jerusalem, and her stubborn
unbelief rendered her doom certain.
The Lord had declared by the prophet Micah: “Hear this,
I pray you, ye heads of the house of Jacob, and princes of the
house of Israel, that abhor judgment, and pervert all equity.
They build up Zion with blood, and Jerusalem with iniquity.
The heads thereof judge for reward, and the priests thereof
teach for hire, and the prophets thereof divine for money;
yet will they lean upon the Lord, and say, Is not the Lord
among us? none evil can come upon us.” Micah 3:9-11.
How exactly did these words describe the corrupt and selfrighteous inhabitants of Jerusalem! While claiming to rigidly observe the law of God, they were transgressing all its
principles. They hated Christ because His purity and holiness revealed their iniquity; and they accused Him of being

18

The

Great

Controversy

the cause of all the troubles which had come upon them in
consequence of their sins. Though they knew Him to be
sinless, they had declared that His death was necessary to
their safety as a nation. “If we let him thus alone,” said the
Jewish leaders, “all men will believe on Him; and the Romans shall come and take away both our place and nation.”
John 11:48. If Christ were sacrificed, they might once more
become a strong, united people. Thus they reasoned, and they
concurred in the decision of their high priest, that it would
be better for one man to die than for the whole nation to
perish.
Thus had the Jewish leaders “built up Zion with blood,
and Jerusalem with iniquity.” And yet, while they slew their
Saviour because He reproved their sins, such was their selfrighteousness that they regarded themselves as God’s favored
people, and expected the Lord to deliver them from their
enemies. “Therefore,” continued the prophet, “shall Zion for
your sake be plowed as a field, and Jerusalem shall become
heaps, and the mountain of the house as the high places of
the forest.” Micah 3:12.
For forty years after the doom of Jerusalem had been
pronounced by Christ Himself, the Lord delayed His
judgments upon the city and the nation. Wonderful was
the long-suffering of God toward the rejecters of His gospel
and the murderers of His Son. The parable of the unfruitful
tree represented God’s dealings with the Jewish nation. The
command had gone forth. “Cut it down; why cumbereth it
the ground?” (Luke 13:7) but divine mercy had spared it yet
a little longer. There were still many among the Jews who
were ignorant of the character and the work of Christ. And
the children had not enjoyed the opportunities or received
the light which their parents had spurned. Through the preaching of the apostles and their associates, God would cause
light to shine upon them; they could see how prophecy had
been fulfilled, not only in the birth and life of Christ, but in
His death and resurrection. The children were not condemned
for the sins of the parents; but when, with a knowledge of all
the light given to their parents, the children rejected the ad-

The

Destruction

of

Jerusalem

[27-29]

1 9

ditional light granted to themselves, they became partakers
of the parents’ sins, and filled up the measure of their iniquity.
The long-suffering of God toward Jerusalem, only confirmed the Jews in their stubborn impenitence. In their
hatred and cruelty toward the disciples of Jesus, they
rejected the last offer of mercy. Then God withdrew His
protection from them, and removed His restraining
power from Satan and his angels, and the nation was left
to the control of the leader she had chosen. Her children
had spurned the grace of Christ, which would have enabled
them to subdue their evil impulses, and now these became
the conquerors. Satan aroused the fiercest and most debased
passions of the soul. Men did not reason; they were beyond
reason,—controlled by impulse and blind rage. They became
Satanic in their cruelty. In the family and in the nation, alike
among the highest and the lowest classes, there was suspicion, envy, hatred, strife, rebellion, murder. There was no
safety anywhere. Friends and kindred betrayed one another.
Parents slew their children, and children their parents. The
rulers of the people had no power to rule themselves. Uncontrolled passions made them tyrants. The Jews had accepted false testimony to condemn the innocent Son of God.
Now false accusations made their own lives uncertain. By
their actions they had long been saying, “Cause the Holy
One of Israel to cease from before us.” Isaiah 30:11. Now
their desire was granted. The fear of God no longer disturbed them. Satan was at the head of the nation, and
the highest civil and religious authorities were under his
sway.
The leaders of the opposing factions at times united to
plunder and torture their wretched victims, and again they
fell upon each other’s forces, and slaughtered without mercy.
Even the sanctity of the temple could not restrain their horrible ferocity. The worshipers were stricken down before the
altar, and the sanctuary was polluted with the bodies of the
slain. Yet in their blind and blasphemous presumption the
instigators of this hellish work publicly declared that they

20

The

Great

Controversy

had no fear that Jerusalem would be destroyed, for it was
God’s own city. To establish their power more firmly, they
bribed false prophets to proclaim, even when Roman legions
were besieging the temple, that the people were to wait for
deliverance from God. To the last, multitudes held fast to
the belief that the Most High would interpose for the defeat
of their adversaries. But Israel had spurned the divine protection, and now she had no defense. Unhappy Jerusalem!
rent by internal dissensions, the blood of her children, slain
by one another’s hands, crimsoning her streets, while alien
armies beat down her fortifications and slew her men of war!
All the predictions given by Christ concerning the destruction of Jerusalem were fulfilled to the letter. The Jews
experienced the truth of His words of warning, “With what
measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.”
Signs and wonders appeared, foreboding disaster and
doom. A comet, resembling a flaming sword, for a year hung
over the city. An unnatural light was seen hovering over the
temple. Upon the clouds were pictured chariots mustering
for battle. Mysterious voices in the temple court uttered the
warning words, “Let us depart hence.” The eastern gate of
the inner court, which was of brass, and so heavy that it was
with difficulty shut by a score of men, and having bolts fastened deep into the firm pavement, was seen at midnight to
be opened of its own accord.
For seven years a man continued to go up and down
the streets of Jerusalem, declaring the woes that were to
come upon the city. By day and by night he chanted the
wild dirge, “A voice from the east; a voice from the west; a
voice from the four winds; a voice against Jerusalem and the
temple; a voice against the bridegroom and the bride; and a
voice against all the people.” This strange being was imprisoned and scourged; but no complaint escaped his lips. To
insult and abuse he answered only, “Woe to Jerusalem! woe,
woe to the inhabitants thereof!” His warning cry ceased not
until he was slain in the siege he had foretold.
Not one Christian perished in the destruction of
Jerusalem. Christ had given His disciples warning, and all

The

Destruction

of

Jerusalem

[29-32]

2 1

who believed His words watched for the promised sign. After the Romans had surrounded the city, they unexpectedly
withdrew their forces, at a time when everything seemed favorable for an immediate attack. In the providence of God
the promised signal was thus given to the waiting Christians,
and without a moment’s delay they fled to a place of safety,—
the refuge city Pella, in the land of Perea, beyond Jordan.
Terrible were the calamities which fell upon Jerusalem in the siege of the city by Titus. The last desperate
assault was made at the time of the passover, when millions of Jews had assembled within its walls to celebrate
the national festival. Their stores of provision, which if carefully preserved would have been sufficient to supply the inhabitants for years, had previously been destroyed through
the jealousy and revenge of the contending factions, and now
all the horrors of starvation were experienced. A measure of
wheat was sold for a talent. Great numbers of the people
would steal out at night, to appease their hunger by devouring herbs and wild plants growing outside the city walls,
though they were often detected, and punished with torture
and death. Some would gnaw the leather on their shields and
sandals. The most inhuman tortures were inflicted by those
in power to force from the want-stricken people the last scanty
supplies which they might have concealed. And these cruelties were not infrequently practiced by men who were themselves well fed, and who were merely desirous of laying up a
store of provision for the future.
Thousands perished from famine and pestilence. Natural affection seemed to have been utterly destroyed. Children would be seen snatching the food from the mouths of
their aged parents. The question of the prophet, “Can a
woman forget her sucking child?” (Isaiah 49:15) received
the answer within the walls of that doomed city. “The hands
of the pitiful women have sodden their own children; they
were their meat in the destruction of the daughter of My
people.” Lamentations 4:10.
The Roman leaders endeavored to strike terror to the
Jews, and thus cause them to surrender. Those prisoners

22

The

Great

Controversy

who resisted when taken, were scourged, tortured, and crucified before the wall of the city. Hundreds were daily put to
death in this manner, and the dreadful work continued until,
along the valley of Jehoshaphat and at Calvary, crosses were
erected in so great numbers that there was scarcely room to
move among them. So terribly was fulfilled the profane prayer
uttered forty years before, “His blood be on us, and on our
children.” Matthew 27:25.
Titus would willingly have put an end to the fearful
scene, and thus have spared Jerusalem the full measure
of her doom. He was filled with horror as he saw the
bodies of the dead lying in heaps in the valleys. Like one
entranced, he looked from the crest of Olivet upon the magnificent temple, and gave command that not one stone of it
be touched. Before attempting to gain possession of this
stronghold, he made an earnest appeal to the Jewish leaders
not to force him to defile the sacred place with blood. If they
would come forth and fight in any other place, no Roman
should violate the sanctity of the temple. Josephus himself,
in a most eloquent appeal, entreated them to surrender, to
save themselves, their city, and their place of worship. But
his words were answered with bitter curses. Darts were hurled
at him, their last human mediator, as he stood pleading with
them. The Jews had rejected the entreaties of the Son of God,
and now expostulation and entreaty only made them more
determined to resist to the last. In vain were the efforts of
Titus to save the temple; One greater than he had declared
that not one stone was to be left upon another.
The blind obstinacy of the Jewish leaders, and the detestable crimes perpetrated within the besieged city, excited the horror and indignation of the Romans, and Titus
at last decided to take the temple by storm. He determined, however, that if possible it should be saved from destruction. But his commands were disregarded. After he had
retired at night to his tent, the Jews, sallying from the temple,
attacked the soldiers without. In the struggle, a firebrand was
flung by a soldier through an opening in the porch, and immediately the chambers about the holy house were in a blaze.

Titus rushed to the place, followed by his generals and legionaries, and commanded the soldiers to quench the flames.
His words were unheeded. In their fury the soldiers hurled
blazing brands into the chambers adjoining the temple, and
then with their swords they slaughtered in great numbers
those who had found shelter there. Blood flowed down the
temple steps like water. Thousands upon thousands of Jews
perished. Above the sound of battle were heard voices shouting, “Ichabod!”—the glory is departed.
The fire had not reached the holy house itself when
Titus entered, and, beholding its unsurpassed splendor,
he was impelled to a last effort for its preservation. But
in his very presence, a soldier thrust a lighted torch between
the hinges of the door, and in an instant the flames burst out
within the sanctuary. As the red glare revealed the walls of
the holy places, glittering with gold, a frenzy seized the soldiers. Goaded on by a desire for plunder, and filled with rage
by the resistance of the Jews, they were beyond control.
The lofty and massive structures that had crowned
Mount Moriah were in flames. The temple towers sent
up columns of fire and smoke. As the lurid tide rolled on,
devouring everything before it, the whole summit of the hill
blazed like a volcano. Mingled with the roar of the fire, the
shouts of the soldiers, and the crash of falling buildings, were
heard the frantic, heart-rending cries of old and young, priests
and rulers. The very mountains seemed to give back the echo.
The awful glare of the conflagration lighted up the surrounding country, and the people gathered upon the hills, and gazed
in terror upon the scene.
After the destruction of the temple, the whole city soon
fell into the hands of the Romans. The leaders of the Jews
forsook their impregnable towers, and Titus found them solitary. He gazed upon them with amazement, and declared that
God had given them into his hands; for no engines, however
powerful, could have prevailed against those stupendous
battlements. Both the city and the temple were razed to their
foundations, and the ground upon which the holy house had
stood was “plowed as a field.” More than a million of the

24

The

Controversy

people were slaughtered; the survivors were carried away as
captives, sold as slaves, dragged to Rome to grace the
conqueror’s triumph, thrown to wild beasts in the amphitheaters, or scattered as homeless wanderers throughout the
earth.
The Jews had forged their own fetters; they had loaded
for themselves the cloud of vengeance. In the utter destruction that befell them as a nation, and in all the woes that
followed them in their dispersion, they were but reaping
the harvest which their own hands had sown. Their sufferings are often represented as a punishment visited upon
them by the direct decree of God. This is a device by which
the great deceiver seeks to conceal his own work. By stubborn rejection of divine love and mercy, the Jews had caused
the protection of God to be withdrawn from them, and Satan
was permitted to rule them according to his will. The horrible cruelties enacted in the destruction of Jerusalem are a
demonstration of Satan’s vindictive power over those who
yield to his control.
We cannot know how much we owe to Christ for the
peace and protection which we enjoy. It is the restraining power of God that prevents mankind from passing
fully under the control of Satan. The disobedient and
unthankful have great reason for gratitude for God’s mercy
and long-suffering in holding in check the cruel, malignant
power of the evil one. But when men pass the limits of divine forbearance, that restraint is removed. God does not
stand toward the sinner as an executioner of the sentence
against transgression; but He leaves the rejecters of His mercy
to themselves, to reap that which they have sown. Every ray
of light rejected, every warning despised or unheeded, every
passion indulged, every transgression of the law of God, is a
seed sown, which yields its unfailing harvest. The Spirit of
God, persistently resisted, is at last withdrawn from the sinner, and then there is left no power to control the evil passions of the soul, and no protection from the malice and enmity of Satan. The destruction of Jerusalem is a fearful and
solemn warning to all who are trifling with the offers of di-

vine grace, and turning away the pleadings of divine mercy.
Never was given a more decisive testimony to God’s hatred
of sin, and to the certain punishment that will fall upon the
guilty.
The Saviour’s prophecy concerning the visitation of
judgments upon Jerusalem is to have another fulfillment,
of which that terrible scene was but a faint shadow. The
second advent of the Son of God is foretold by lips which
make no mistake: “Then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn,
and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of
heaven, with power and great glory. And He shall send His
angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather
together His elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven
to the other.” Matthew 24:30, 31. Then shall they that obey
not the gospel be consumed with the spirit of His mouth,
and destroyed with the brightness of His coming. 2 Thessalonians 2:8.
Let men beware lest they neglect the lesson conveyed
to them in the words of Christ. He has declared that He
will come the second time, to gather His faithful ones to Himself, and to take vengeance on them that reject His mercy. As
He warned His disciples of Jerusalem’s destruction, giving them a sign of the approaching ruin that they might
make their escape, so He has warned His people of the
day of final destruction, and given them signs of its approach, that all who will may flee from the wrath to come.
Those who behold the promised signs are to “know that it is
near, even at the door.” “Watch ye therefore,” are His words
of admonition. “If thou shalt not watch, I will come on thee
as a thief.”
The world is no more ready now to credit the warning than were the Jews in the days of our Saviour. Come
when it may, the end will come unawares to the ungodly.
When life is going on in its unvarying round; when men are
absorbed in pleasure, in business, in traffic, in money-making; when religious leaders are magnifying the world’s
progress and enlightenment, and the people are lulled in a
false security,—then, as the midnight thief steals within the

In A.D. 66, when Florus (the Roman procurator of Judea) made mistakes,
the Jews appealed to Agrippa (who earlier had listened to Paul in Acts 26:28)—
and were told to forget it. It was August 66. They threw stones at him as he left
the city; and for the next four years, Jerusalem was to know no peace.
Some of the Jews immediately seized parts of Jerusalem, and fighting
broke out among them. The Roman garrison, in the Fortress Antonia (next to the
Temple Mount), was slaughtered. Ananias the high priest and his brother, descendants of the Annas who condemned Christ, were slain by Jewish factions
who then turned on one another.
Retaliating, Florus slew 20,000 Jews in Caesarea. Jews then attacked cities throughout Judea. Finally, the dilatory Cestius Gallus, legate of Syria, decided to do something. Heading south with 30,000 troops, he burnt Joppa and
then surrounded Jerusalem. Just as the Jewish moderates were about to hand
over the city, he unexpectedly withdrew. Encouraged, the Jews set off in pursuit,
and Cestius lost much equipment, all his siege engines and nearly 6,000 soldiers. “Running and singing,” the Jews returned to Jerusalem and to a terrible
fate. It was the end of October, A.D. 67.
February 68, Nero appointed his best general, Vespasian, to command the
Roman armies. Heading south toward Jerusalem, he quickly took Jotapata, Joppa
again, and all of Galilee, and sold 30,000 Jews into slavery. At the Jordan, he
slew 15,000 Jews,—but then on June 9, Vespasian learned that Nero had committed suicide. Hurrying to Rome, he became enmeshed in battles for the emperorship, which he won in October, A.D. 69.
By that time, all Judea, except Jerusalem, was under the control of Titus,
his thirty-year-old son who was now general of the armies. On May 10, A.D. 70,
with 65,000 men, Titus arrived at the gates of Jerusalem. Every type of horror
was experienced within its walls before Titus gained control, 139 days later.
Yet 39 years before, Christ had foretold this suffering and destruction. He
had warned His followers to keep the Sabbath faithfully (Matthew 24:20) and
flee when the Roman armies had arrived (verse 16). This they did, when Cestius
withdrew from the city in October, A.D. 67.
Jerusalem itself had been divided into three sectors, each under its own
rebel force, and each fighting the others. With the help of battering rams, banks,
75-foot towers, and hurling machines, the Romans took the Fortress Antonia by
the end of July, and the Temple in August.
Three more weeks, and all Jerusalem was burned to the ground. Not knowing
Christ’s prediction, Titus ordered that the city be leveled flat. Not one stone was
left upon another. Over 1,100,000 Jews died during the siege. Most of those
remaining were sold into slavery. The Temple treasures were taken to Rome.

When Jesus revealed to His disciples the fate of Jerusalem and the scenes of the second advent, He foretold also
the experience of His people from the time when He
should be taken from them, to His return in power and
glory for their deliverance. From Olivet the Saviour beheld the storms about to fall upon the apostolic church, and,
penetrating deeper into the future, His eye discerned the
fierce, wasting tempests that were to beat upon His followers in the coming ages of darkness and persecution.
In a few brief utterances, of awful significance, He foretold
the portion which the rulers of this world would mete out to
the church of God. The followers of Christ must tread the
same path of humiliation, reproach, and suffering which their
Master trod. The enmity that burst forth against the world’s
Redeemer, would be manifested against all who should believe on His name.
The history of the early church testified to the fulfillment
of the Saviour’s words. The powers of earth and hell arrayed themselves against Christ in the person of His fol-

lowers. Paganism foresaw that should the gospel triumph,
her temples and altars would be swept away; therefore
she summoned her forces to destroy Christianity. The fires
of persecution were kindled. Christians were stripped of their
possessions, and driven from their homes. They “endured a
great fight of afflictions.” They “had trial of cruel mockings
and scourgings, yea, moreover of bonds and imprisonment.”
Hebrews 11:36. Great numbers sealed their testimony with
their blood. Noble and slave, rich and poor, learned and ignorant, were alike slain without mercy.
Wherever they sought refuge, the followers of Christ
were hunted like beasts of prey. They were forced to seek
concealment in desolate and solitary places. “Destitute, afflicted, tormented, of whom the world was not worthy, they
wandered in deserts, and in mountains, and in dens and caves
of the earth.” Hebrews 11:37, 38. The subterranean excavations connected with the city of Rome afforded shelter for
thousands. Long galleries had been tunneled through earth
and rock to procure material for the vast structures of the
capital, and the dark and intricate network of passages extended for miles beyond the walls. In these underground retreats, many of the followers of Christ, when suspected and

ATING OF THIS REMARK
ABLE CHAPTER—

REMARKABLE
HISTORICAL D
The events in this chapter span a period of time from A.D. 64 through
the mid-seventh century. But several of its most important events
(during the time of Constantine) occurred between A.D. 311 to 337.
The persecutions against Christians began under the Roman
emperor, Nero, about July of A.D. 64, and continued on intermittently for centuries. It was the Christian writer, Tertullian (197-227)
who, about the year 206, wrote to the emperor, Septimius Severus,
that “the blood of Christians is seed.”
In April 311, the Roman persecutions against the Christians
suddenly ceased, as Constantine I, with his associates, issued an
Edict of Toleration. Now that the Church had become popular, unscriptural errors from paganism immediately began crowding into
it. During Constantine’s reign (306-337), the Church became the official religion of the Roman Empire.
Persecution of Bible-believing Christians, by half-converted pagan church leaders, began—and continued on for centuries.

proscribed, found a home; and here also they buried their
dead. When the Lifegiver shall awaken those who have fought
the good fight, many a martyr for Christ’s sake will come
forth from those gloomy caverns.
Under the fiercest persecution, these witnesses for
Jesus kept their faith unsullied. Though deprived of every
comfort, shut away from the light of the sun, making their
home in the dark but friendly bosom of the earth, they uttered no complaint. With words of faith, patience, and hope,
they encouraged one another to endure privation and distress. The loss of every earthly blessing could not force them
to renounce their belief in Christ. Trials and persecutions
were but steps bringing them nearer their rest and their reward.
They called to mind the words of their Master, that
when persecuted for Christ’s sake they were to be exceeding glad; for great would be their reward in Heaven;
for so had the prophets been persecuted before them. Like
God’s servants of old, they were “tortured, not accepting
deliverance, that they might obtain a better resurrection.”
Hebrews 11:35. They rejoiced that they were accounted worthy to suffer for the truth, and songs of triumph ascended in
the midst of crackling flames. Looking upward by faith, they
saw Christ and angels leaning over the battlements of Heaven,
gazing upon them with the deepest interest, and regarding
their steadfastness with approval. A voice came down to them
from the throne of God, “Be thou faithful unto death, and I
will give thee a crown of life.” Revelation 2:10.
In vain were Satan’s efforts to destroy the church of
Christ by violence. The great controversy in which the disciples of Jesus yielded up their lives did not cease when these
faithful standard-bearers fell at their post. By defeat they
conquered. God’s workmen were slain, but His work went
steadily forward. The gospel continued to spread, and the
number of its adherents to increase. It penetrated into regions that were inaccessible, even to the eagles of Rome.
Said a Christian, expostulating with the heathen rulers who
were urging forward the persecution: “You may torment, af-

32

The

flict, and vex us. Your wickedness puts our weakness to the
test, but your cruelty is of no avail. It is but a stronger invitation to bring others to our persuasion. The more we are
mowed down, the more we spring up again. The blood of the
Christians is seed.”
Thousands were imprisoned and slain, but others
sprung up to fill their places. And those who were martyred
for their faith were secured to Christ, and accounted of Him
as conquerors. They had fought the good fight, and they were
to receive the crown of glory when Christ should come. The
sufferings which they endured brought Christians nearer to
one another and to their Redeemer. Their living example and
dying testimony were a constant witness for the truth; and,
where least expected, the subjects of Satan were leaving his
service, and enlisting under the banner of Christ.
Satan therefore laid his plans to war more successfully against the government of God, by planting his banner in the Christian church. If the followers of Christ could
be deceived, and led to displease God, then their strength,
fortitude, and firmness would fail, and they would fall an
easy prey.
The great adversary now endeavored to gain by artifice what he had failed to secure by force. Persecution
ceased, and in its stead were substituted the dangerous
allurements of temporal prosperity and worldly honor.
Idolaters were led to receive a part of the Christian faith,
while they rejected other essential truths. They professed to
accept Jesus as the Son of God, and to believe in His death
and resurrection; but they had no conviction of sin, and felt
no need of repentance or of a change of heart. With some
concessions on their part, they proposed that Christians
should make concessions, that all might unite on the platform of belief in Christ.
Now was the church in fearful peril. Prison, torture,
fire, and sword were blessings in comparison with this. Some
of the Christians stood firm, declaring that they could make
no compromise. Others reasoned that if they should yield or
modify some features of their faith, and unite with those who

Persecution in the First Centuries

[41-44]

3 3

had accepted a part of Christianity, it might be the means of
their full conversion. That was a time of deep anguish to the
faithful followers of Christ. Under a cloak of pretended Christianity, Satan was insinuating himself into the church, to corrupt their faith, and turn their minds from the word of truth.
At last the larger portion of the Christian company
lowered their standard, and a union was formed between
Christianity and paganism. Although the worshipers of
idols professed to be converted, and united with the church,
they still clung to their idolatry, only changing the objects of
their worship to images of Jesus, and even of Mary and the
saints. The foul leaven of idolatry, thus introduced into the
church, continued its baleful work. Unsound doctrines, superstitious rites, and idolatrous ceremonies were incorporated into her faith and worship. As the followers of Christ
united with idolaters, the Christian religion became corrupted,
and the church lost her purity and power. There were some,
however, who were not misled by these delusions. They still
maintained their fidelity to the Author of truth, and worshiped
God alone.
There have ever been two classes among those who
profess to be followers of Christ. While one class study
the Saviour’s life, and earnestly seek to correct their defects
and to conform to the Pattern, the other class shun the plain,
practical truths which expose their errors. Even in her best
estate, the church was not composed wholly of the true, pure,
and sincere. Our Saviour taught that those who willfully indulge in sin are not to be received into the church; yet He
connected with Himself men who were faulty in character,
and granted them the benefits of His teachings and example,
that they might have an opportunity to see and correct their
errors. Among the twelve apostles was a traitor. Judas was
accepted, not because of his defects of character, but notwithstanding them. He was connected with the disciples, that,
through the instructions and example of Christ, he might
learn what constitutes Christian character, and thus be led to
see his errors, to repent, and, by the aid of divine grace, to
purity his soul “in obeying the truth.” But Judas did not walk

34

The

Great

Controversy

in the light so graciously permitted to shine upon him. By
indulgence in sin, he invited the temptations of Satan. His
evil traits of character became predominant. He yielded his
mind to the control of the powers of darkness, he became
angry when his faults were reproved, and thus he was led to
commit the fearful crime of betraying his Master. In like
manner do all who cherish evil under a profession of godliness hate those who disturb their peace by condemning
their course of sin. When a favorable opportunity is presented, they will, like Judas, betray those who for their
good have sought to reprove them.
The apostles encountered those in the church who professed godliness while they were secretly cherishing iniquity. Ananias and Sapphira acted the part of deceivers, pretending to make an entire sacrifice for God, when they were
covetously withholding a portion for themselves. The Spirit
of truth revealed to the apostles the real character of these
pretenders, and the judgments of God forever rid the church
of this foul blot upon its purity. This signal evidence of the
discerning Spirit of Christ in the church was a terror to hypocrites and evil-doers. They could not long remain in connection with those who were, in habit and disposition, constant
representatives of Christ; and as trials and persecution came
upon His followers, those only who were willing to forsake
all for the truth’s sake desired to become His disciples. Thus,
as long as persecution continued, the church remained comparatively pure. But as it ceased, converts were added who
were less sincere and devoted, and the way was opened for
Satan to obtain a foothold.
But there is no union between the Prince of light and
the prince of darkness, and there can be no union between their followers. When Christians consented to unite
with those who were but half converted from paganism, they
entered upon a path which led farther and farther from the
truth. Satan exulted that he had succeeded in deceiving so
large a number of the followers of Christ. He then brought
his power to bear more fully upon them, and inspired them
to persecute those who remained true to God. None could so

Persecution in the First Centuries

[44-46]

3 5

well understand how to oppose the true Christian faith as
could those who had once been its defenders; and these apostate Christians, uniting with their half-pagan companions,
directed their warfare against the most essential features of
the doctrines of Christ.
It required a desperate struggle for those who would
be faithful to stand firm against the deceptions and abominations which were disguised in sacerdotal garments and
introduced into the church. The Bible was not accepted as
the standard of faith. The doctrine of religious freedom
was termed heresy, and its upholders were hated and proscribed.
After a long and severe conflict, the faithful few decided to dissolve all union with the apostate church if
she still refused to free herself from falsehood and idolatry. They saw that separation was an absolute necessity if
they would obey the word of God. They dared not tolerate
errors fatal to their own souls, and set an example which
would imperil the faith of their children and children’s children. To secure peace and unity they were ready to make any
concession consistent with fidelity to God; but they felt that
even peace would be too dearly purchased at the sacrifice of
principle. If unity could be secured only by the compromise
of truth and righteousness, then let there be difference, and
even war.
Well would it be for the church and the world if the
principles that actuated those steadfast souls were revived in the hearts of God’s professed people. There is an
alarming indifference in regard to the doctrines which are
the pillars of the Christian faith. The opinion is gaining
ground, that, after all, these are not of vital importance. This
degeneracy is strengthening the hands of the agents of Satan, so that false theories and fatal delusions which the faithful in ages past imperiled their lives to resist and expose, are
now regarded with favor by thousands who claim to be followers of Christ.
The early Christians were indeed a peculiar people.
Their blameless deportment and unswerving faith were a con-

36

The

Great

Controversy

tinual reproof that disturbed the sinner’s peace. Though few
in numbers, without wealth, position, or honorary titles, they
were a terror to evil-doers wherever their character and doctrines were known. Therefore they were hated by the wicked,
even as Abel was hated by the ungodly Cain. For the same
reason that Cain slew Abel did those who would throw
off the restraint of the Holy Spirit, put to death God’s
people. It was for the same reason that the Jews rejected and
crucified the Saviour,—because the purity and holiness of
His character was a constant rebuke to their selfishness and
corruption. From the days of Christ until now, His faithful
disciples have excited the hatred and opposition of those who
love and follow the ways of sin.
How, then, can the gospel be called a message of peace?
When Isaiah foretold the birth of the Messiah, he ascribed to
Him the title, “Prince of peace.” When angels announced to
the shepherds that Christ was born, they sung above the plains
of Bethlehem, “Glory to God in the highest, and on earth
peace, good will toward men.” Luke 2:14. There is a seeming contradiction between these prophetic declarations and
the words of Christ, “I came not to send peace, but a sword.”
Matthew 10:34. But rightly understood, the two are in perfect harmony. The gospel is a message of peace. Christianity
is a system, which, received and obeyed, would spread peace,
harmony, and happiness throughout the earth. The religion
of Christ will unite in close brotherhood all who accept its
teachings. It was the mission of Jesus to reconcile man to
God, and thus to his fellow-man. But the world at large
are under the control of Satan, Christ’s bitterest foe. The
gospel presents to them principles of life which are wholly
at variance with their habits and desires, and they rise
in rebellion against it. They hate the purity which reveals
and condemns their sins, and they persecute and destroy those
who would urge upon them its just and holy claims. It is in
this sense—because the exalted truths it brings, occasion
hatred and strife—that the gospel is called a sword.
The mysterious providence which permits the righteous
to suffer persecution at the hand of the wicked, has been a

Persecution in the First Centuries

[46-48]

3 7

cause of great perplexity to many who are weak in faith.
Some are even ready to cast away their confidence in God
because He suffers the basest of men to prosper, while the
best and purest are afflicted and tormented by their cruel
power. How, it is asked, can One who is just and merciful,
and who is also infinite in power, tolerate such injustice and
oppression? This is a question with which we have nothing
to do. God has given us sufficient evidence of His love,
and we are not to doubt His goodness because we cannot understand the workings of His providence. Said the
Saviour to His disciples, foreseeing the doubts that would
press upon their souls in days of trial and darkness, “Remember the word that I said unto you, The servant is not
greater than His lord. If they have persecuted Me, they will
also persecute you.” John 15:20. Jesus suffered for us more
than any of His followers can be made to suffer through the
cruelty of wicked men. Those who are called to endure torture and martyrdom, are but following in the steps of God’s
dear Son.
“The Lord is not slack concerning His promise.” 2
Peter 3:9. He does not forget or neglect His children;
but He permits the wicked to reveal their true character,
that none who desire to do His will may be deceived concerning them. Again, the righteous are placed in the furnace of affliction, that they themselves may be purified; that
their example may convince others of the reality of faith and
godliness; and also that their consistent course may condemn
the ungodly and unbelieving.
God permits the wicked to prosper, and to reveal their
enmity against Him, that when they shall have filled up
the measure of their iniquity, all may see His justice and
mercy in their utter destruction. The day of His vengeance
hastens, when all the transgressors of His law and the oppressors of His people will meet the just recompense of their
deeds; when every act of cruelty or oppression toward God’s
faithful ones will be punished as though done to Christ Himself.
There is another and more important question that should

38

The

Great

Controversy

engage the attention of the churches of to-day. The apostle
Paul declares that “all that will live godly in Christ Jesus
shall suffer persecution.” 2 Timothy 3:12. Why is it, then,
that persecution seems in a great degree to slumber?—The
only reason is, that the church has conformed to the world’s
standard, and therefore awakens no opposition. The religion
current in our day is not of the pure and holy character which
marked the Christian faith in the days of Christ and His
apostles. It is only because of the spirit of compromise
with sin, because the great truths of the word of God are
so indifferently regarded, because there is so little vital
godliness in the church, that Christianity is apparently
so popular with the world. Let there be a revival of the
faith and power of the early church, and the spirit of persecution will be revived, and the fires of persecution will be
rekindled.

For three hundred years fierce persecution lashed at the
early Christian Church, and then in A.D. 311, peace came

Roman
Empire, decided for political reasons to become friends
with the Churc
Church—and what it brought changed all history for
all time to come —

what they were —

———————————————————————

The apostle Paul, in his second letter to the Thessalonians, foretold great apostasy which would result in
the establishment of the papal power. He declared that the
day of Christ should not come, “except there come a falling
away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition; who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is
called God, or that is worshiped; so that he as God sitteth in
the temple of God, showing himself that he is God.” And
furthermore, the apostle warns his brethren that “the mystery of iniquity doth already work.” 2 Thessalonians 2:3, 4,
7. Even at that early date he saw, creeping into the church,
errors that would prepare the way for the development of the
papacy.
Little by little, at first in stealth and silence, and then more
openly as it increased in strength and gained control of the
minds of men, the mystery of iniquity carried forward its
deceptive and blasphemous work. Almost imperceptibly
the customs of heathenism found their way into the Chris-

tian church. The spirit of compromise and conformity was
restrained for a time by the fierce persecutions which the
church endured under paganism. But as persecution ceased,
and Christianity entered the courts and palaces of kings,
she laid aside the humble simplicity of Christ and His
apostles for the pomp and pride of pagan priests and
rulers; and in place of the requirements of God, she substituted human theories and traditions. The nominal conversion of Constantine, in the early part of the fourth century, caused great rejoicing; and the world, arrayed in robes
of righteousness, walked into the church. Now the work of
corruption rapidly progressed. Paganism, while appearing
to be vanquished, became the conqueror. Her spirit controlled
the church. Her doctrines, ceremonies, and superstitions were
incorporated into the faith and worship of the professed followers of Christ.
This compromise between paganism and Christianity resulted in the development of the man of sin foretold
in prophecy as opposing and exalting himself above God.

primary dates in this chapter cover nine centuries—from A.D. 311
(Constantine’s Edict of Toleration) to 1229 (when the Inquisition began). The papacy was firmly established by the sixth century; and, in
A.D. 538, the 1260 years of papal oppression (predicted in Daniel
7:25 and Revelation 13:5-7) began.
The Second Council of Nicea (A.D. 787) finalized the establishment of image worship as a necessary part of Catholic worship. But
it was Constantine’s decree of march 7, 321, making Sunday a public
holy day, that laid the foundation for the their apostasy. The Council
of Laodicea (c. 337) officially endorsed that first National Sunday
Law.
Shortly afterward, candles were burned before images and
prayers were made to them. Gradually the apostasy deepened.
By the Sixth Century the papacy was firmly established in power;
and, in A.D. 538, the terrible 1260 years of papal oppression, predicted in Daniel 7:25 and Revelation 13:5-7, began.
As though purgatory, prayers for the dead, and paid indulgences
for sin were not enough, the terrible Inquisition, on an “official” basis, began in order to slay Christians—and also seize the property of
wealthy Catholics. Millions were to die under its stroke.

42

The

Great

Controversy

That gigantic system of false religion is a masterpiece of
Satan’s power,—a monument of his efforts to seat himself
upon the throne to rule the earth according to his will.
Satan once endeavored to form a compromise with Christ.
He came to the Son of God in the wilderness of temptation,
and, showing Him all the kingdoms of the world and the
glory of them, offered to give all into His hands if He would
but acknowledge the supremacy of the prince of darkness.
Christ rebuked the presumptuous tempter, and forced him to
depart. But Satan meets with greater success in presenting
the same temptations to man. To secure worldly gains and
honors, the church was led to seek the favor and support of
the great men of earth, and having thus rejected Christ, she
was induced to yield allegiance to the representative of Satan,—the bishop of Rome.
It is one of the leading doctrines of Romanism that
the pope is the visible head of the universal church of
Christ, invested with supreme authority over bishops and
pastors in all parts of the world. More than this, the pope
has arrogated the very titles of Deity. He styles himself “Lord
God the Pope,” assumes infallibility, and demands that all
men pay him homage. Thus the same claim urged by Satan
in the wilderness of temptation is still urged by him through
the church of Rome, and vast numbers are ready to yield him
homage.
But those who fear and reverence God meet this Heavendaring assumption as Christ met the solicitations of the wily
foe: “Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and Him only
shalt thou serve.” Luke 4:8. God has never given a hint in
His word that He has appointed any man to be the head of
the church. The doctrine of papal supremacy is directly opposed to the teachings of the Scriptures. The pope can have
no power over Christ’s church except by usurpation.
Romanists have persisted in bringing against Protestants
the charge of heresy, and willful separation from the true
church. But these accusations apply rather to themselves.
They are the ones who laid down the banner of Christ, and
departed from the faith once delivered to the saints.

The Roman Church

[50-52]

4 3

Satan well knew that the Holy Scriptures would enable
men to discern his deceptions and withstand his power. It
was by the word that even the Saviour of the world has resisted his attacks. At every assault, Christ presented the shield
of eternal truth, saying, “It is written.” To every suggestion
of the adversary He opposed the wisdom and power of the
word. In order for Satan to maintain his sway over men,
and establish the authority of the papal usurper, he must
keep them in ignorance of the Scriptures. The Bible would
exalt God, and place finite men in their true position; therefore its sacred truths must be concealed and suppressed. This
logic was adopted by the Roman Church. For hundreds of
years the circulation of the Bible was prohibited. The
people were forbidden to read it, or to have it in their
houses, and unprincipled priests and prelates interpreted its
teachings to sustain their pretensions. Thus the pope came
to be almost universally acknowledged as the vicegerent of
God on earth, endowed with supreme authority over Church
and State.
The detector of error having been removed, Satan worked
according to his will. Prophecy had declared that the papacy
was to “think to change times and laws.” Daniel 7:25. This
work it was not slow to attempt. To afford converts from
heathenism a substitute for the worship of idols, and thus
to promote their nominal acceptance of Christianity, the
adoration of images and relics was gradually introduced
into the Christian worship. The decree of a general council finally established this system of popish idolatry. To complete the sacrilegious work, Rome presumed to expunge from
the law of God the second commandment, forbidding image
worship, and to divide the tenth commandment, in order to
preserve the number.
The spirit of concession to paganism opened the way for
a still further disregard of Heaven’s authority. Satan tampered with the fourth commandment also, and essayed
to set aside the ancient Sabbath, the day which God had
blessed and sanctified, and in its stead to exalt the festival observed by the heathen as “the venerable day of the

44

The

Great

Controversy

sun.” This change was not at first attempted openly. In the
first centuries the true Sabbath had been kept by all Christians. They were jealous for the honor of God, and, believing that His law is immutable, they zealously guarded the
sacredness of its precepts. But with great subtlety, Satan
worked through his agents to bring about his object. That
the attention of the people might be called to the Sunday, it
was made a festival in honor of the resurrection of Christ.
Religious services were held upon it; yet it was regarded as a
day of recreation, the Sabbath being still sacredly observed.
Constantine, while still a heathen, issued a decree enjoining the general observance of Sunday as a public festival
throughout the Roman empire. After his conversion, he remained a staunch advocate of Sunday, and his pagan edict
was then enforced by him in the interests of his new faith.
But the honor shown this day was not as yet sufficient to
prevent Christians from regarding the true Sabbath as the
holy of the Lord. Another step must be taken; the false Sabbath must be exalted to an equality with the true. A few years
after the issue of Constantine’s decree, the bishop of
Rome conferred on the Sunday the title of Lord’s day.
Thus the people were gradually led to regard it as possessing a degree of sacredness. Still the original Sabbath
was kept.
The arch-deceiver had not completed his work. He was
resolved to gather the Christian world under his banner, and
to exercise his power through his vicegerent, the proud pontiff who claimed to be the representative of Christ. Through
half-converted pagans, ambitious prelates, and world-loving churchmen, he accomplished his purpose. Vast councils
were held, from time to time, in which the dignitaries of the
church were convened from all the world. In nearly every
council the Sabbath which God had instituted was
pressed down a little lower, while the Sunday was correspondingly exalted. Thus the pagan festival came finally
to be honored as a divine institution, while the Bible Sabbath was pronounced a relic of Judaism, and its observers
were declared to be accursed.

The Roman Church

[52-54]

The great apostate had succeeded in exalting himself
“above all that is called God, or that is worshiped.” 2
Thessalonians 2:4. He had dared to change the only precept of the divine law that unmistakably points all mankind to the true and living God. In the fourth commandment, God is revealed as the Creator of the heavens and
the earth, and is thereby distinguished from all false gods.
It was as a memorial of the work of creation that the seventh
day was sanctified as a rest-day for man. It was designed to
keep the living God ever before the minds of men as the
source of being and the object of reverence and worship.
Satan strives to turn men from their allegiance to God, and
from rendering obedience to His law; therefore he directs his
efforts especially against that commandment which points
to God as the Creator.
Protestants now urge that the resurrection of Christ
on Sunday, made it the Christian Sabbath. But Scripture evidence is lacking. No such honor was given to the
day by Christ or His apostles. The observance of Sunday as
a Christian institution has its origin in that “mystery of lawlessness” which, even in Paul’s day, had begun its work.
Where and when did the Lord adopt this child of the papacy? What valid reason can be given for a change concerning which the Scriptures are silent?
In the sixth century the papacy had become firmly established. Its seat of power was fixed in the imperial city, and
the bishop of Rome was declared to be the head over the
entire church. Paganism had given place to the papacy.
The dragon had given to the beast “his power, and his
seat, and great authority.” Revelation 13:2. And now began the 1260 years of papal oppression foretold in the prophecies of Daniel and John. Daniel 7:25; Revelation 13:5-7.
Christians were forced to choose, either to yield their integrity and accept the papal ceremonies and worship, or to wear
away their lives in dungeon cells, or suffer death by the rack,
the fagot, or the headsman’s ax. Now were fulfilled the words
of Jesus, “Ye shall be betrayed both by parents, and brethren, and kinsfolks, and friends; and some of you shall they

46

The

Great

Controversy

cause to be put to death. And ye shall be hated of all men for
my name’s sake.” Luke 21:16, 17. Persecution opened upon
the faithful with greater fury than ever before, and the
world became a vast battle-field. For hundreds of years
the church of Christ found refuge in seclusion and obscurity.
Thus says the prophet: “The woman fled into the wilderness, where she hath a place prepared of God, that they should
feed her there a thousand two hundred and three-score days.”
Revelation 12:6.
The accession of the Roman Church to power marked the
beginning of the Dark Ages. As her power increased, the
darkness deepened. Faith was transferred from Christ, the
true foundation, to the pope of Rome. Instead of trusting in
the Son of God for forgiveness of sins and for eternal salvation, the people looked to the pope, and to the priests
and prelates to whom he delegated authority. They were
taught that the pope was their mediator, and that none
could approach God except through him, and, further, that
he stood in the place of God to them, and was therefore to be
implicitly obeyed. A deviation from his requirements was
sufficient cause for the severest punishment to be visited upon
the bodies and souls of the offenders. Thus the minds of the
people were turned away from God to fallible, erring, and
cruel men, nay more, to the prince of darkness himself, who
exercised his power through them. Sin was disguised in a
garb of sanctity. When the Scriptures are suppressed, and
man comes to regard himself as supreme, we need look only
for fraud, deception, and debasing iniquity. With the elevation of human laws and traditions was manifest the corruption that ever results from setting aside the law of
God.
Those were days of peril for the church of Christ. The
faithful standard-bearers were few indeed. Though the truth
was not left without witnesses, yet at times it seemed that
error and superstition would wholly prevail, and true religion would be banished from the earth. The gospel was lost
sight of, but the forms of religion were multiplied, and the
people were burdened with rigorous exactions.

The Roman Church

[54-56]

4 7

They were taught not only to look to the pope as their
mediator, but to trust to works of their own to atone for sin.
Long pilgrimages, acts of penance, the worship of relics,
the erection of churches, shrines, and altars, the payment
of large sums to the church,—these and many similar
acts were enjoined to appease the wrath of God or to secure His favor; as if God were like men, to be angered at
trifles, or pacified by gifts or acts of penance!
Notwithstanding vice prevailed, even among the leaders
of the Romish Church, her influence seemed steadily to increase. About the close of the eighth century, papists put
forth the claim that in the first ages of the church the bishops
of Rome had possessed the same spiritual power which they
now assumed. To establish this claim, some means must be
employed to give it a show of authority; and this was readily
suggested by the father of lies. Ancient writings were forged
by monks. Decrees of councils before unheard of were
discovered, establishing the universal supremacy of the
pope from the earliest times. And a church that had rejected the truth greedily accepted these deceptions.
The few faithful builders upon the true foundation were
perplexed and hindered as the rubbish of false doctrine obstructed the work. Like the builders upon the wall of Jerusalem in Nehemiah’s day, some were ready to say, “The strength
of the bearers of burdens is decayed, and there is much rubbish, so that we are not able to build.” Nehemiah 4:10. Wearied with the constant struggle against persecution, fraud,
iniquity, and every other obstacle that Satan could devise to
hinder their progress, some who had been faithful builders
became disheartened; and for the sake of peace and security
for their property and their lives they turned away from the
true foundation. Others, undaunted by the opposition of their
enemies, fearlessly declared, “Be not ye afraid of them; remember the Lord, which is great and terrible” (Nehemiah
4:14), and they proceeded with the work, every one with his
sword girded by his side.
The same spirit of hatred and opposition to the truth
has inspired the enemies of God in every age, and the

48

The

Great

Controversy

same vigilance and fidelity have been required in His servants. The words of Christ to the first disciples are applicable to His followers to the close of time: “What I say unto
you, I say unto all, Watch.” Mark 13:37.
The darkness seemed to grow more dense. Image
worship became more general. Candles were burned
before images, and prayers were offered to them. The
most absurd and superstitious customs prevailed. The
minds of men were so completely controlled by superstition
that reason itself seemed to have lost her sway. While priests
and bishops were themselves pleasure-loving, sensual, and
corrupt, it could only be expected that the people who looked
to them for guidance would be sunken in ignorance and vice.
Another step in papal assumption was taken, when, in the
eleventh century, Pope Gregory VII proclaimed the perfection of the Romish Church. Among the propositions which
he put forth, was one declaring that the church had never
erred, nor would it ever err, according to the Scriptures.
But the Scripture proofs did not accompany the assertion.
The proud pontiff next claimed the power to depose emperors, and declared that no sentence which he pronounced could
be reversed by any one, but that it was his prerogative to
reverse the decisions of all others.
A striking illustration of the tyrannical character of this
advocate of infallibility was given in his treatment of the
German king, Henry IV. For presuming to disregard the
pope’s authority, this monarch was declared to be excommunicated and dethroned. In order to make his peace
with Rome, Henry crossed the Alps in midwinter that he
might humble himself before the pope. Upon reaching the
castle whither Gregory had withdrawn, he was conducted,
without his guards, into an outer court, and there, in the severe cold of winter, with uncovered head and naked feet and
in a miserable dress, he awaited the pope’s permission to
come into his presence. Not until he had continued three days
fasting and making confession did the pontiff condescend to
grant him pardon. Even then it was only upon condition that
the emperor should await the sanction of the pope before

The

Roman

Church

[57-59]

4 9

resuming the insignia or exercising the power of royalty. And
Gregory, elated with his triumph, boasted that it was his duty
“to pull down the pride of kings.”
How striking the contrast between the overbearing
pride of this haughty pontiff and the meekness and gentleness of Christ, who represents Himself as pleading at the
door of the heart for admittance, that He may come in to
bring pardon and peace, and who taught His disciples, “Whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your servant.”
Matthew 20:27.
The advancing centuries witnessed a constant increase
of error in the doctrines put forth from Rome. Even before the establishment of the papacy, the teachings of heathen philosophers had received attention and exerted an influence in the church. Many who professed conversion still
clung to the tenets of their pagan philosophy, and not only
continued its study themselves, but urged it upon others as a
means of extending their influence among the heathen. Thus
were serious errors introduced into the Christian faith.
Prominent among these was the belief in man’s natural
immortality and his consciousness in death. This doctrine
laid the foundation upon which Rome established the invocation of saints and the adoration of the virgin Mary.
From this sprung also the heresy of eternal torment for
the finally impenitent, which was early incorporated into
the papal faith.
Then the way was prepared for the introduction of still
another invention of paganism, which Rome named purgatory, and employed to terrify the credulous and superstitious
multitudes. By this heresy is affirmed the existence of a place
of torment, in which the souls of such as have not merited
eternal damnation are to suffer punishment for their sins,
and from which, when freed from impurity, they are admitted to Heaven.
Still another fabrication was needed to enable Rome to
profit the fears and the vices of her adherents. This was supplied by the doctrine of indulgences. Full remission of sins,
past, present, and future, and release from all the pains and

50

The

Great

Controversy

penalties incurred, were promised to all who would enlist in
the pontiff’s wars to extend his temporal dominion, to punish his enemies, or to exterminate those who dared deny his
spiritual supremacy. The people were also taught that by
the payment of money to the church they might free themselves from sin, and also release the souls of their deceased
friends who were confined in the tormenting flames. By such
means did Rome fill her coffers, and sustain the magnificence, luxury, and vice of the pretended representatives of
Him who had not where to lay His head.
The scriptural ordinance of the Lord’s supper had
been supplanted by the idolatrous sacrifice of the mass.
Papist priests pretended, by their senseless mummery, to
convert the simple bread and wine into the actual body and
blood of Christ. With blasphemous presumption, they openly
claimed the power to “create their Creator.” All Christians
were required, on pain of death, to avow their faith in this
horrible, Heaven-insulting heresy. Those who refused were
given to the flames.
In the thirteenth century was established that most
terrible of all the engines of the papacy,—the Inquisition. The prince of darkness wrought with the leaders of the
papal hierarchy. In their secret councils, Satan and his angels presided, while unseen in the midst stood an angel of
God, taking the fearful record of their iniquitous decrees,
and writing the history of deeds too horrible to appear to
human eyes. “Babylon the great” was “drunken with the
blood of the saints.” The mangled forms of millions of martyrs cried to God for vengeance upon that apostate power.
Popery had become the world’s despot. Kings and emperors bowed to the decrees of the Roman pontiff. The destinies of men, both for time and for eternity, seemed under
his control. For hundreds of years the doctrines of Rome had
been extensively and implicitly received, its rites reverently
performed, its festivals generally observed. Its clergy were
honored and liberally sustained. Never since has the Roman
Church attained to greater dignity, magnificence, and power.

The noontide of the papacy was the world’s moral midnight. The Holy Scriptures were almost unknown, not
only to the people, but to the priests. Like the Pharisees of
old, the papist leaders hated the light which would reveal
their sins. God’s law, the standard of righteousness, having
been removed, they exercised power without limit, and practiced vice without restraint. Fraud, avarice, and profligacy
prevailed. Men shrank from no crime by which they could
gain wealth or position. The palaces of popes and prelates
were scenes of the vilest debauchery. Some of the reigning
pontiffs were guilty of crimes so revolting that secular rulers
endeavored to depose these dignitaries of the church as monsters too vile to be tolerated upon the throne. For centuries
there was no progress in learning, arts, or civilization. A
moral and intellectual paralysis had fallen upon Christendom.
In the condition of the world under the Romish power
was presented a fearful and striking fulfillment of the words
of the prophet Hosea: “My people are destroyed for lack
of knowledge. Because thou hast rejected knowledge, I will
also reject thee.” “Seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy
God, I will also forget thy children.” “There is no truth, nor
mercy, nor knowledge of God in the land. By swearing, and
lying, and killing, and stealing, and committing adultery, they
break out, and blood toucheth blood.” Hosea 4:6, 1, 2. Such
were the results of banishing the word of God.

her. (2) The dogma of Mary as the Co-redemptrix of the world. The
thought here is that the redemption of mankind, from start to finish,
is done through Mary, working together at each step with Christ.
“Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day [the second advent of Christ] shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and
that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition; who opposeth and exalteth
himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped; so that he as
God sitteth in the temple of God, shewing himself that he is God." 2 Thessalonians 2:3-4.
“Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill you, and ye
shall be hated of all nations for My name’s sake.” Matthew 24:9.
“Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock, . . For I know
this: that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not
sparing the flock. Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after them. Therefore watch and remember.” Acts 20:28-31.
“For then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be. But pray ye that your
flight be not in the winter, neither on the Sabbath day.”—Matt 24:21, 20.

— The Waldenses

———————————————————————

Many years ago there was a group of people who lived in the
mountains of south-central Europe. They loved God and their
Bibles, and as a result they were persecuted and hunted for their
faith. What caused it all? How did they survive? DID they survive?

———————————————————————

Amid the gloom that settled upon the earth during
the long period of papal supremacy, the light of truth
could not be wholly extinguished. In every age there were
witnesses for God,—men who cherished faith in Christ as
the only mediator between God and man, who led the Bible
as the only rule of life, and who hallowed the true Sabbath.
How much the world owes to these men, posterity will never
know. They were branded as heretics, their motives impugned, their characters maligned, their writings suppressed,
misrepresented, or mutilated. Yet they stood firm, and from
age to age maintained their faith in its purity, as a sacred
heritage for the generations to come.
The history of God’s faithful people for hundreds of
years after Rome attained to power, is known alone to
heaven. They cannot be traced in human records, except as
hints of their existence are found in the censures and accusations of their persecutors. It was the policy of Rome to
obliterate every trace of dissent from her doctrines or
decrees. Everything heretical, whether persons or writings,
was destroyed. A single expression of doubt, a question as

The

to the authority of papal dogmas, was enough to cost the life
of rich or poor, high or low. Rome endeavored also to destroy every record of her cruelty toward dissenters. Papal
councils decreed that books and writings containing such
records should be committed to the flames. Before the invention of printing, books were few in number, and in a form
not favorable for preservation; therefore there was little to
prevent the Romanists from carrying out their purpose.
No church within the limits of Romish jurisdiction was
long left undisturbed in the enjoyment of freedom of conscience. No sooner had the papacy obtained power than she
stretched out her arms to crush all that refused to acknowledge her sway, and one after another, the churches submitted
to her dominion.
In Great Britain a primitive Christianity had very
early taken root. Faithful men had preached the gospel in
that country with great zeal and success. Among the leading
evangelists was an observer of the Bible Sabbath, and thus
this truth found its way among the people for whom he labored. Toward the close of the sixth century, missionaries were sent from Rome to England to convert the bar———————————
ATING OF THIS ASTOUNDING CHAPTER—
DA
HISTORICAL D
The information about the early British Christians covers the years
from before A.D. 300 through 800.
Very early, before A.D. 300, Christian missionaries came to Britain with pure Bible truths. Upon being persecuted, they fled northward to Scotland, and thence to Ireland. Columba (521-597) from
Ireland, went to Scotland and founded an island missionary station
on Iona in 563. From there, missionaries were sent to many European countries, and finally in 614 to Italy.
Roman agents arrived in A.D. 596 and won the heathen Saxons
to their worldly religion. For more than a thousand years, Christians
were heavily persecuted; throughout this time believers in the Bible
Sabbath continued to share their faith in parts of Europe, Asia, and
Africa.
The history of the Waldenses (also called Vaudois) spans more
than a millennium of persecution and bloodshed, till the mid-19th
century. It was Pope Innocent VIII who, in 1487, ordered them to be
“crushed as venomous serpents.”

barian Saxons. They induced many thousands to profess the
Romish faith, and as the work progressed, the papal leaders
and their converts encountered the primitive Christians. A
striking contrast was presented. The latter were simple,
humble, and scriptural in character, doctrine, and manners,
while the former manifested the superstition, pomp, and arrogance of popery. The emissary of Rome demanded that
these Christian churches acknowledge the supremacy of the
sovereign pontiff. The Britons meekly replied that they desired to love all men, but that the pope was not entitled to
supremacy in the church, and they could render to him only
that submission which was due to every follower of Christ.
Repeated attempts were made to secure their allegiance to
Rome; but these humble Christians, amazed at the pride displayed by her apostles, steadfastly replied that they knew no
other master than Christ. Now the true spirit of the papacy was revealed. Said the Romish leader, “If you will not
receive brethren who bring you peace, you shall receive enemies who will bring you war. If you will not unite with us in
showing the Saxons the way of life, you shall receive from
them the stroke of death.” These were no idle threats. War,
intrigue, and deception were employed against these witnesses for a Bible faith, until the churches of Britain were
destroyed, or forced to submit to the authority of the pope.
In lands beyond the jurisdiction of Rome, there existed for many centuries bodies of Christians who remained almost wholly free from papal corruption. They
were surrounded by heathenism, and in the lapse of ages were
affected by its errors; but they continued to regard the Bible
as the only rule of faith, and adhered to many of its truths.
These Christians believed in the perpetuity of the law of
God, and observed the Sabbath of the fourth commandment. Churches that held to this faith and practice, existed
in Central Africa and among the Armenians of Asia.
But of those who resisted the encroachments of the
papal power, the Waldenses stood foremost. For centuries the churches of Piedmont maintained their independence; but the time came at last when Rome demanded

The

W

their submission. After ineffectual struggles against her tyranny, the leaders of these churches reluctantly acknowledged
the supremacy of the power to which the whole world seemingly bowed down to. A considerable number, however, refused to yield to the authority of pope or prelate. They were
determined to maintain their allegiance to God, and to
preserve the purity and simplicity of their faith. A separation took place. Some of the protesters crossed the Alps,
and raised the standard of truth in foreign lands. Others retired into the more secluded valleys among the mountains,
and there maintained their freedom to worship God.
The religious belief of the Waldenses was founded upon
the written word of God, the true system of Christianity,
and was in marked contrast to the errors of Rome. But
those herdsmen and vine-dressers, in their obscure retreats,
shut away from the world, had not themselves arrived at the
truth in opposition to the dogmas and heresies of the apostate church. Theirs was not a faith newly received. Their religious belief was their inheritance from their fathers. They
contended for the faith of the apostolic church, —“the faith
once delivered to the saints.”
Among the leading causes that had led to the separation of the true church from Rome, was the inveterate
hatred of the latter toward the Bible Sabbath. As foretold by prophecy, the papal power cast down the truth to the
ground. The law of God was trampled in the dust, while the
traditions and customs of men were exalted. The churches
that were under the rule of the papacy were early compelled
to honor the Sunday as a holy day. Amid the prevailing error
and superstition, many even of the true people of God, became so bewildered that while they observed the Sabbath,
they refrained from labor also on the Sunday. But this did
not satisfy the papal leaders. They demanded not only that
Sunday be hallowed, but that the Sabbath be profaned; and
they denounced, in the strongest language, those who dared
to show it honor. It was only by fleeing from the power of
Rome that any could obey God’s law in peace.
The Waldenses were the first of all the peoples of Eu-

rope to obtain a translation of the Scriptures. Hundreds
of years before the Reformation, they possessed the entire Bible in manuscript in their native tongue. They had
the truth unadulterated, and this rendered them the special
objects of hatred and persecution. They declared the Church
of Rome to be the apostate Babylon of the Apocalypse, and
at the peril of their lives they stood up to resist her corruptions. While, under the pressure of long-continued persecution, some compromised their faith, little by little yielding
its distinctive principles, others held fast the truth. Through
ages of darkness and apostasy, there were Waldenses who
denied the supremacy of Rome, who rejected image worship as idolatry, and who kept the true Sabbath. Under
the fiercest tempests of opposition they maintained their faith.
Though gashed by the Savoyard spear, and scorched by the
Romish fagot, they stood unflinchingly for God’s word and
His honor. They would not yield one iota of the truth.
Behind the lofty bulwarks of the mountains,—in all
ages the refuge of the persecuted and oppressed,—the
Waldenses found a hiding-place. Here the lamp of truth
was kept burning during the long night that descended upon
Christendom. Here for a thousand years they maintained their
ancient faith.
God had provided for His people a sanctuary of awful
grandeur, befitting the mighty truths committed to their trust.
To those faithful exiles, the mountains were an emblem of
the immutable righteousness of Jehovah. They pointed their
children to the heights towering above them in unchanging
majesty, and spoke to them of Him with whom there is no
variableness nor shadow of turning, whose word is as enduring as the everlasting hills. God had set fast the mountains, and girded them with strength; no arm but that of infinite power could move them out of their place. In like manner had He established His law, the foundation of His government in Heaven and upon earth. The arm of man might
reach his fellow-men and destroy their lives; but that arm
could as readily uproot the mountains from their foundations, and hurl them into the sea, as it could change

one precept of the law of Jehovah, or blot out one of His
promises to those who do His will. In their fidelity to His
law, God’s servants should be as firm as the unchanging hills.
The mountains that girded their lowly valleys were a constant witness of God’s creative power, and a never-failing
assurance of His protecting care. Those pilgrims learned to
love the silent symbols of Jehovah’s presence. They indulged
no repining because of the hardships of their lot; they were
never lonely amid the mountain solitudes. They thanked God
that He had provided for them an asylum from the wrath and
cruelty of men. They rejoiced in their freedom to worship
before Him. Often when pursued by their enemies, the
strength of the hills proved a sure defense. From many a
lofty cliff they chanted the praise of God, and the armies of
Rome could not silence their songs of thanksgiving.
Pure, simple, and fervent was the piety of these followers
of Christ. The principles of truth they valued above houses
and lands, friends, kindred, even life itself. These principles they earnestly sought to impress upon the hearts
of the young. From earliest childhood the youth were instructed in the Scriptures, and taught to sacredly regard the
claims of the law of God. Copies of the Bible were rare;
therefore its precious words were committed to memory.
Many were able to repeat large portions of both the Old and
the New Testament. Thoughts of God were associated alike
with the sublime scenery of nature and with the humble blessings of daily life. Little children learned to look with gratitude to God as the giver of every favor and every comfort.
Parents, tender and affectionate as they were, loved
their children too wisely to accustom them to self-indulgence. Before them was a life of trial and hardship, perhaps
a martyr’s death. They were educated from childhood to endure hardness, to submit to control, and yet to think and act
for themselves. Very early they were taught to bear responsibilities, to be guarded in speech, and to understand
the wisdom of silence. One indiscreet word let fall in the
hearing of their enemies, might imperil not only the life of
the speaker, but the lives of hundreds of his brethren; for as

60

wolves hunting their prey did the enemies of truth pursue
those who dared to claim freedom of religious faith.
The Waldenses had sacrificed their worldly prosperity for
the truth’s sake, and with persevering patience they toiled
for their bread. Every spot of tillable land among the mountains was carefully improved; the valleys and the less fertile
hillsides were made to yield their increase. Economy and
severe self-denial formed a part of the education which
the children received as their only legacy. They were taught
that God designs life to be a discipline, and that their wants
could be supplied only by personal labor, by forethought,
care, and faith. The process was laborious and wearisome,
but it was wholesome, just what man needs in his fallen state,
the school which God has provided for his training and development.
While the youth were inured to toil and hardship, the culture of the intellect was not neglected. They were taught
that all their powers belonged to God, and that all were
to be improved and developed for His service.
The church of the Alps, in its purity and simplicity, resembled the church in the first centuries. The shepherds of
the flock led their charge to the fountain of living waters,—
the word of God. On the grassy slopes of the valleys, or in
some sheltered glen among the hills, the people gathered
about the servants of Christ to listen to the words of truth.
Here the youth received instruction. The Bible was their
text-book. They studied and committed to memory the
words of Holy Writ. A considerable portion of their time
was spent, also, in reproducing copies of the Scriptures. Some
manuscripts contained the whole Bible, others only brief selections, to which some simple explanations of the text were
added by those who were able to expound the Scriptures.
Thus were brought forth the treasures of truth so long concealed by those who sought to exalt themselves above God.
By patient, untiring labor, sometimes in the deep, dark
caverns of the earth, by the light of torches, were the Sacred
Scriptures written out, verse by verse, chapter by chapter.
Thus the work went on, the revealed will of God shining out

The

[67-70]

6 1

like pure gold; how much brighter, clearer, and more powerful because of the trials undergone for its sake, only those
could realize who were engaged in the work. Angels from
Heaven surrounded these faithful workers.
Satan had urged on the papal bishops and prelates to
bury the word of truth beneath the rubbish of error, heresy, and superstition; but in a most wonderful manner
was it preserved uncorrupted through all the ages of
darkness. It bore not the stamp of man, but the impress of
God. Men have been unwearied in their efforts to obscure
the plain, simple meaning of the Scriptures, and to make
them contradict their own testimony; but, like the ark upon
the billowy deep, the word of God outrides the storms that
threaten it with destruction. As the mine has rich veins of
gold and silver hidden beneath the surface, so that all must
dig who would discover its precious stores, so the Holy Scriptures have treasures of truth that are unfolded only to the
earnest, humble, prayerful seeker. God designed the Bible to
be a lesson-book to all mankind, in childhood, youth, and
manhood, and to be studied through all time. He gave His
word to men as a revelation of Himself. Every new truth
discerned is a fresh disclosure of the character of its Author.
The study of the Scriptures is the means divinely ordained
to bring men into closer connection with their Creator,
and to give them a clearer knowledge of His will. It is the
medium of communication between God and man.
When the Waldensian youth had spent some time in their
schools in the mountains, some of them were sent to complete their education in the great cities, where they could have
a wider range for thought and observation than in their secluded homes. The youth thus sent forth were exposed to
temptation, they witnessed vice, they encountered Satan’s
wily agents, who urged upon them the most subtle heresies
and the most dangerous deceptions. But their education
from childhood had been of a character to prepare them
for all this.
In the schools whither they went, they were not to make
confidants of any. Their garments were so prepared as to

62

The

Great

Controversy

conceal their greatest treasure,—the precious manuscripts
of the Scriptures. These, the fruit of months and years of
toil, they carried with them, and whenever it could be done
without exciting suspicion, they cautiously placed some portion in the way of those whose hearts seemed open to receive
it. From their mother’s knee the Waldensian youth had been
trained with this purpose in view; they understood their work,
and faithfully performed it. Converts to the true faith were
won in these institutions of learning, and frequently its principles were found to be permeating the entire school; yet the
papist leaders could not, by the closest inquiry, trace the socalled corrupting heresy to its source.
The Waldenses felt that God required more of them than
merely to maintain the truth in their own mountains; that a
solemn responsibility rested upon them to let their light
shine forth to those who were in darkness; that by the
mighty power of God’s word, they were to break the
bondage which Rome had imposed. It was a law among
them that all who entered the ministry should, before taking
charge of a church at home, serve three years in the missionary field. As the hands of the men of God were laid upon
their heads, the youth saw before them, not the prospect of
earthly wealth or glory, but possibly a martyr’s fate. The
missionaries began their labors in the plains and valleys at
the foot of their own mountains, going forth two and two, as
Jesus sent out His disciples. These co-laborers were not always together, but often met for prayer and counsel, thus
strengthening each other in the faith.
To make known the nature of their mission would have
insured its defeat; therefore they concealed their real character under the guise of some secular profession, most commonly that of merchants or peddlers. They offered for sale
silks, jewelry, and other valuable articles, and were received
as merchants where they would have been repulsed as missionaries. All the while their hearts were uplifted to God for
wisdom to present a treasure more precious than gold or gems.
They carried about with them portions of the Holy Scriptures concealed in their clothing or merchandise, and

The

W

Waldenses

[70-73]

whenever they could do so with safety, they called the
attention of the inmates of the dwelling to these manuscripts. When they saw that an interest was awakened, they
left some portion with them as a gift.
With naked feet and in coarse garments, these missionaries passed through great cities, and traversed provinces far
removed from their native valleys. Everywhere they scattered the precious seed. Churches sprang up in their path,
and the blood of martyrs witnessed for the truth. The
day of God will reveal a rich harvest of souls garnered by the
labors of these faithful men. Veiled and silent, the word of
God was making its way through Christendom, and meeting
a glad reception in the homes and hearts of men.
To the Waldenses the Scriptures were not merely a record
of God’s dealings with men in the past, and a revelation of
the responsibilities and duties of the present, but an unfolding of the perils and glories of the future. They believed that
the end of all things was not far distant; and as they studied
the Bible with prayer and tears, they were the more deeply
impressed with its precious utterances, and with their duty
to make known to others its saving truths. They saw the plan
of salvation clearly revealed in the word of God, and they
found comfort, hope, and peace in believing in Jesus. As the
light illuminated their understanding and made glad their
hearts, they longed to shed its beams upon those who
were in the darkness of papal error.
They saw that under the guidance of pope and priests,
multitudes were vainly endeavoring to obtain pardon, by afflicting their bodies for the sin of their souls. Taught to trust
their good works to save them, they were ever looking to
themselves, their minds dwelling upon their sinful condition,
seeing themselves exposed to the wrath of God, afflicting
soul and body, yet finding no relief. Thus were conscientious souls bound by the doctrines of Rome. Thousands abandoned friends and kindred, and spent their lives in convent
cells. By oft-repeated fasts and cruel scourgings, by midnight vigils, by prostration for weary hours upon the cold,
damp stones of their dreary abode, by long pilgrimages, by

64

The

Great

Controversy

humiliating penance and fearful torture, many vainly sought
to obtain peace of conscience. Oppressed with a sense of
sin, and haunted with the fear of God’s avenging wrath, they
suffered on, until exhausted nature gave way, and without
one ray of light or hope, they sank into the tomb.
The Waldenses longed to break to those starving souls
the bread of life, to open to them the messages of peace
in the promises of God, and to point them to Christ as
their only hope of salvation. The doctrine that good works
can make satisfaction for transgression of God’s law, they
held to be based upon falsehood. Reliance upon human merits intercepts the view of Christ’s infinite love. Jesus died as
men’s sacrifice, because they can do nothing to recommend
themselves to God. The merits of a crucified and risen Saviour are the foundation of the Christian’s faith. The union of
the soul to Christ by faith is as real, as close, as that of a
limb to the body, or of a branch to the vine.
The teachings of popes and priests had led men to look
upon the character of God, and even of Christ, as stern,
gloomy, and forbidding. The Saviour of the world was represented as so far devoid of all sympathy with man in his
fallen state that the mediation of priests and saints must
be invoked. How those whose minds had been enlightened
by the word of God longed to point these souls to Jesus as
their compassionate, loving Saviour, standing with outstretched arms, inviting all to come to Him with their burden
of sin, their care and weariness. They longed to clear away
the obstructions which Satan had piled up that men might
not see the promises, and come directly to God, confessing
their sins, and obtaining pardon and peace.
Eagerly did the Vaudois [Waldensian] missionary unfold
to the inquiring mind the precious truths of the gospel. Cautiously he produced the carefully written portions of the word
of God. It was his greatest joy to give hope to the conscientious, sin-stricken soul, who could see only a God of vengeance, waiting to execute justice. With quivering lip and
tearful eye did he, often on bended knees, open to his
brethren the precious promises that reveal the sinner’s

The

W

Waldenses

[73-74]

6 5

only hope. Thus the light of truth penetrated many a
darkened mind, rolling back the cloud of gloom, until the
Sun of Righteousness shone into the heart with healing in
His beams. Some portions of Scripture were read again and
again, the hearer desiring them to be often repeated, as if he
would assure himself that he had heard aright. Especially
was the repetition of these words eagerly desired: “The blood
of Jesus Christ His Son cleanseth us from all sin.” 1 John
1:7. “As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even
so must the Son of man be lifted up, that whosoever believeth
in Him should not perish, but have eternal life.” John 3:14,
15.
Many were undeceived in regard to the claims of Rome.
They saw how vain is the mediation of men or angels in
behalf of the sinner. As the true light dawned upon their
minds, they exclaimed with rejoicing, “Christ is my
priest; His blood is my sacrifice; His altar is my confessional.” They cast themselves wholly upon the merits of
Jesus, repeating the words, “Without faith it is impossible
to please Him.” Hebrews 11:6. “There is none other name
under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.”
Acts 4:12.
The assurance of a Saviour’s love seemed too much for
some of these poor tempest-tossed souls to realize. So great
was the relief which it brought, such a flood of light was
shed upon them, that they seemed transported to Heaven.
Their hand was laid confidingly in the hand of Christ; their
feet were planted upon the Rock of Ages. All fear of death
was banished. They could now covet the prison and the fagot
if they might thereby honor the name of their Redeemer.
In secret places the word of God was thus brought forth
and read, sometimes to a single soul, sometimes to a little
company who were longing for light and truth. Often the
entire night was spent in this manner. So great would be the
wonder and admiration of the listeners that the messenger of
mercy was not infrequently compelled to cease his reading
until the understanding could grasp the tidings of salvation.
Often would words like these be uttered: “Will God indeed

66

The

Great

accept my offering? Will He smile upon me? Will He pardon
me?” The answer was read, “Come unto me, all ye that labor
and are heavy-laden, and I will give you rest.” Matthew 11:28.
Faith grasps the promise, and the glad response is heard,
“No more long pilgrimages to make; no more painful
journeys to holy shrines. I may come to Jesus just as I
am, sinful and unholy, and He will not spurn the penitential
prayer. ‘Thy sins be forgiven thee.’ Mine, even mine, may
be forgiven.”
A tide of sacred joy would fill the heart, and the name of
Jesus would be magnified by praise and thanksgiving. Those
happy souls returned to their homes to diffuse light, to repeat to others, as well as they could, their new experience;
that they had found the true and living Way. There was a
strange and solemn power in the words of Scripture that
spoke directly to the hearts of those who were longing
for the truth. It was the voice of God, and it carried conviction to those who heard.
The messenger of truth went on his way; but his appearance of humility, his sincerity, his earnestness and deep fervor, were subjects of frequent remark. In many instances his
hearers had not asked him whence he came, or whither he
went. They had been so overwhelmed, at first with surprise,
and afterward with gratitude and joy, that they had not thought
to question him. When they had urged him to accompany
them to their homes, he had replied that he must visit the lost
sheep of the flock. Could he have been an angel from Heaven?
they queried.
In many cases the messenger of truth was seen no more.
He had made his way to other lands, he was wearing out his
life in some unknown dungeon, or perhaps his bones were
whitening on the spot where he had witnessed for the truth.
But the words he had left behind could not be destroyed.
They were doing their work in the hearts of men: the blessed
results will be fully known only in the Judgment.
The Waldensian missionaries were invading the kingdom of Satan, and the powers of darkness aroused to
greater vigilance. Every effort to advance the truth was

The

watched by the prince of evil, and he excited the fears of his
agents. The papal leaders saw a portent of danger to their
cause from the labors of those humble itinerants. If the light
of truth were allowed to shine unobstructed, it would sweep
away the heavy clouds of error that enveloped the people; it
would direct the minds of men to God alone, and would eventually destroy the supremacy of Rome.
The very existence of this people, holding the faith of
the ancient church, was a constant testimony to Rome’s
apostasy, and therefore excited the most bitter hatred
and persecution. Their refusal to surrender the Scriptures
was also an offense that Rome could not tolerate. She determined to blot them from the earth. Now began the most
terrible crusades against God’s people in their mountain homes. Inquisitors were put upon their track, and
the scene of innocent Abel falling before the murderous Cain
was often repeated.
Again and again were their fertile lands laid waste, their
dwellings and chapels swept away, so that where once were
flourishing fields and the homes of an innocent, industrious
people, there remained only a desert. As the ravenous beast
is rendered more furious by the taste of blood, so was the
rage of the papists kindled to greater intensity by the sufferings of their victims. Many of these witnesses for a pure
faith were pursued across the mountains, and hunted down
in the valleys where they were hidden, shut in by mighty
forests and pinnacles of rock.
No charge could be brought against the moral character
of this proscribed class. Even their enemies declared them to
be a peaceable, quiet, pious people. Their grand offense
was that they would not worship God according to the
will of the pope. For this crime, every humiliation, insult, and torture that men or devils could invent was
heaped upon them.
When Rome at one time determined to exterminate the
hated sect, a bull was issued by the pope condemning them
as heretics, and delivering them to slaughter. They were not
accused as idlers, or dishonest, or disorderly; but it was de-

68

The

Great

Controversy

clared that they had an appearance of piety and sanctity that
seduced “the sheep of the true fold.” Therefore the pope ordered “that the malicious and abominable sect of malignants,”
if they refuse to abjure, “be crushed like venomous snakes.”
Did this haughty potentate expect to meet those words again?
Did he know that they were registered in the books of Heaven,
to confront him at the Judgment? “Inasmuch as ye have done
it unto one of the least of these my brethren,” said Jesus, “ye
have done it unto Me.” Matthew 25:40.
This bull invited all Catholics to take up the cross against
the heretics. In order to stimulate them in this cruel work, it
absolved them from all ecclesiastical pains and penalties, it
released all who joined the crusade from any oaths they might
have taken; it legalized their title to any property which they
might have illegally acquired, and promised remission of all
their sins to such as should kill any heretic. It annulled all
contracts made in favor of the Vaudois, ordered their domestics to abandon them, forbade all persons to give them any
aid whatever, and empowered all persons to take possession
of their property. How clearly does this document reveal the
master spirit behind the scenes! It is the roar of the dragon,
and not the voice of Christ, that is heard therein.
The papal leaders would not conform their characters to the great standard of God’s law, but erected a
standard to suit themselves, and determined to compel
all to conform to this because Rome willed it. The most
horrible tragedies were enacted. Corrupt and blasphemous
priests and popes were doing the work which Satan appointed
them. Mercy had no place in their natures. The same spirit
that crucified Christ, and that slew the apostles, the same
that moved the blood-thirsty Nero against the faithful in his
day, was at work to rid the earth of those who were beloved
of God.
The persecutions visited for many centuries upon this Godfearing people were endured by them with a patience and
constancy that honored their Redeemer. Notwithstanding the
crusades against them, and the inhuman butchery to which
they were subjected, they continued to send out their mis-

[77-78]

sionaries to scatter the precious truth. They were hunted to
the death; yet their blood watered the seed sown, and it
failed not of yielding fruit. Thus the Waldenses witnessed
for God, centuries before the birth of Luther. Scattered
over many lands, they planted the seeds of the Reformation
that began in the time of Wycliffe, grew broad and deep in
the days of Luther, and is to be carried forward to the close
of time by those who also are willing to suffer all things for
“the word of God and for the testimony of Jesus Christ.”

“Rites and ceremonies, of which neither Paul nor Peter ever heard, crept
silently into use, and then claimed the rank of divine institutions. Officers
for whom the primitive disciples could have found no place, and titles which
to them would have been altogether unintelligible, began to challenge attention, and to be named ‘apostolic.’ ” William D. Killen, The Ancient Church,
p. xvi.
“The belief in miracle-working objects, talismans, amulets, and formulas was dear to . . Christianity, and they were received from pagan antiquity
. . the vestments of the clergy and the papal title of ‘pontifix maximus’ were
legacies from pagan Rome. The [Catholic] Church found that rural converts still revered certain springs, wells, trees, and stones; she thought it
wiser to bless these to Christian use . . Pagan festivals, dear to the people,
reappeared as Christian feasts, and pagan rites were transformed into Christian liturgy . . The Christian calendar of saints replaced the Roman ‘fasti’
[calendar of gods]; ancient divinities dear to the people were allowed to
revive under the names of ‘Christian saints’ . . Gradually the tenderest features of Astarte, Cybele, Artemis, Diana, and Isis were gathered together
in the worship of Mary.” Will Durant, The Age of Faith, 1950, pp. 745-746.
“The [Catholic] Church took the pagan philosophy and made it the buckler
of faith against the heathen. She took the pagan Roman Pantheon, temple
of all gods, and made it sacred to all the martyrs; so it stands to this day.
She took the pagan Sun day and made it the Christian Sunday. She took the
pagan Easter [in honor of Ishtar] and made it the feast we celebrate during
this season . . The sun was a foremost god with heathendom . . Hence the
Church would seem to say, ‘Keep that old pagan name [Sunday]. It shall
remain consecrated, sanctified.’ And thus the pagan Sunday, dedicated to

Balder, became the Christian Sunday, sacred to Jesus.” William L. Gildea,
“Paschale Gaudium,” in The Catholic World, 58, March, 1894, p. 809.
“It is not necessary to go into the subject which the diligence of Protestant writers has made familiar to most of us: the use of temples dedicated
to particular saints, . . holy water; asylums [monasteries]; holydays and
seasons, use of saints’ calendars, processions, . . are all of pagan origin,
and sanctified by their adoption into the church.” John Henry Newman, An
Essay on the Development of Christian Doctrine, p. 373 (1906).
“Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day [the second advent of Christ] shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and
that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition; who opposeth and exalteth
himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped; so that he as
God sitteth in the temple of God, shewing himself that he is God.” 2 Thessalonians 2:3-4.
“The mighty Catholic Church was little more than the Roman Empire
baptized. Rome was transformed as well as converted . . It is not a matter
of great surprise, therefore, to find that from the first to the fourth century,
the Church had undergone many changes.” Alexander C. Flick, Rise of the
Medieval Church, pp. 148-149.
“Pictures of Christ, Mary, and the saints, had been already worshipped
from the fifth century with greetings, kisses, prostration, a renewal of ancient pagan practices. In the naive and confident conviction that Christians
no longer ran any risk of idolatry, the Church not only tolerated, but promoted, the entrance of paganism . . A brisk trade was carried on in the
seventh and beginning of the eighth century in images, especially by monks;
churches and chapels were crowded with pictures and relics; the practice
of heathen times was revived.” Adolph Harnack, History of Dogma, Vol. 4,
pp. 318-319 (1898).
“From ancient Babylon came the cult of the virgin mother-godess, who
was worshiped as the highest of gods.” S.H. Langdon, Semitic Mythology,
1931 ed.
Laing mentions several pagan practices by which the mother-goddess
was worshiped by heathens, that Rome adopted into Christianity: holy water,
votive offerings, elevation of sacred objects [lifting of the host], the priest’s
bells, the decking of images, processions, festivals, prayers for the dead,
the worship of relics and the statutes of saints. See Gordon J. Laing, Survivals of Roman Religion, 1831 edition, pp. 92-95, 123-131, 238-241.

— Early Reformers

———————————————————————

Once there was a time when the common people didn’t have
Bibles. Think of it! Almost no Bibles anywhere. They weren’t allowed to have them. Then came a man who determined to give
the Bible to his people —
Read what happened when he did it. This is the story of a man
of God—the story of John Wycliffe. It is also the stor
storyy of John
Huss, a man who would not give in, though prison doors beckoned and death awaited him —

———————————————————————

So bitter had been the war waged upon the Bible, that
at times there were very few copies in existence; but God
had not suffered His word to be wholly destroyed. Its
truths were not to be forever hidden. He could as easily unchain the words of life as He could open prison doors and
unbolt iron gates to set His servants free. In the different
countries of Europe, men were moved by the Spirit of God
to search for the truth as for hidden treasure. Providentially
guided to the Holy Scriptures, they studied the sacred pages
with intense interest. They were willing to accept the light,
at any cost to themselves. Though they did not see all things
clearly, they were enabled to perceive many long-buried
truths. As Heaven-sent messengers they went forth, rending
asunder the chains of error and superstition, and calling upon
those who had been so long enslaved to arise and assert their
liberty.
Except among the Waldenses, the word of God had
for ages been locked up in languages known only to the
learned; but the time had come for the Scriptures to be

translated, and given to the people of different lands in their
native tongue. The world had passed its midnight. The
hours of darkness were wearing away, and in many lands
appeared tokens of the coming dawn.
In the fourteenth century arose in England the “morning star of the Reformation.” John Wycliffe was the herald of reform, not for England alone, but for all
Christendom. He was the progenitor of the Puritans; his
era was an oasis in the desert.
Wycliffe received a liberal education, and with him the
fear of the Lord was the beginning of wisdom. He was noted
at college for his fervent piety as well as for his remarkable
talents and sound scholarship. He was educated in the civil
and the canon law, and sought to become acquainted with
every branch of knowledge. In his after-labors the value of
this early discipline was apparent. While he could wield the
sword of the Spirit, he was acquainted also with the practice
of the schools. This combination of accomplishments won
for him the respect of all parties. His followers saw with
satisfaction that their teacher was foremost among the sages
and doctors of his time. The Lord saw fit to intrust the work
of reform to one whose intellectual ability would give character and dignity to his labors. This silenced the voice of
contempt, and prevented the adversaries of truth from attempting to put discredit upon his cause by ridiculing the
ignorance of the advocate.
When Wycliffe had mastered the learning of the schools,

about John Wycliffe (1328-1415) occurred between A.D. 1328 and
1415. He became pastor of Lutterworth in 1374; and, in 1377, papal
bulls were hurled against him. Two rival popes were elected in 1378—
and the Great Schism began. Their fighting lasted until 1415. Between 1382 and 1384, Wycliffe translated the Bible into English.
The events concerning John Huss and Jerome happened between 1396 and 1428. He was appointed rector of the university church
and the Bethlehem chapel in 1402. His denunciations of corruption
began in 1405, and Prague was placed under interdict in 1412. The
Council of Constance (1414-1418) burned Huss in 1415, and Jerome
in 1416. The Hussite Wars lasted until 1434.

he entered upon the study of the Scriptures. Every subject to
which he turned his attention he was accustomed to investigate thoroughly, and he pursued the same course with the
Bible. Heretofore he had felt a great want, which neither
his scholastic studies nor the teachings of the church could
satisfy. In the Scriptures he found that which he had before sought in vain. Here he saw the plan of salvation
revealed, and Christ set forth as the only advocate for
man. He saw that Rome had forsaken the Biblical paths for
human traditions. He gave himself to the service of Christ,
and determined to proclaim the truths which he had discovered.
He commenced with great prudence, but as he discerned
more clearly the errors of the papacy, he taught more earnestly the doctrine of faith. His knowledge of theology, his
penetrating mind, the purity of his life, and his unbending
courage and integrity, won for him general confidence and
esteem. He was an able and earnest teacher, and an eloquent
preacher, and his daily life was a demonstration of the truths
he preached. He accused the clergy of having banished
the Holy Scriptures, and demanded that the authority of
the Bible should be reestablished in the church. Many of
the people had become dissatisfied with their former faith as
they saw the iniquity that prevailed in the Roman Church,
and they hailed with unconcealed joy the truths brought to
view in these discussions; but the papist leaders trembled
with rage when they perceived that this reformer was gaining an influence greater than their own.
Wycliffe was a clear thinker and a keen detector of
error, and he struck boldly against many of the abuses
sanctioned by the authority of Rome. Thus he brought
upon himself the enmity of the pope and his supporters. Repeated attempts were made to condemn and execute him for
heresy; but God had given him favor with princes, who stood
in his defense. While acting as chaplain for the king, he had
taken a bold stand against the payment of the tribute claimed
by the pope from the English monarch, and had declared the
papal assumption of authority over secular rulers to be con-

74

The

Great

Controversy

trary to both reason and revelation. A few years later, he
ably defended the rights of the English crown against the
encroachments of the Romish power. The people and the
nobility of England sided with him, and his enemies could
accomplish nothing against him. Upon one occasion, when
he was brought to trial before a synod of bishops, the people
surrounded the building where the synod met, and, rushing
in, stood between him and all harm.
About this time, strife was caused in the church by
the conflicting claims of two rival popes. Each professed
infallibility, and demanded obedience. Each called upon
the faithful to assist him to make war upon the other,
enforcing his demand by terrible anathemas against his adversaries, and promises of rewards in Heaven to his supporters. This occurrence greatly weakened the power of the
papacy, and saved Wycliffe from further persecution.
God had preserved His servant for more important labors. Wycliffe, like his Master, preached the gospel to the
poor. As a professor of theology, he presented the truth to
the students under his instruction, and received the title of
“The Gospel Doctor.” In his parish he addressed the people
as a friend and pastor.
But the greatest work of his life was the translation of
the Scriptures into the English language. This was the
first complete English translation ever made. The art of
printing being still unknown, it was only by slow and wearisome labor that copies of the work could be multiplied; yet
this was done, and the people of England received the Bible
in their own tongue. Thus the light of God’s word began to
shed its bright beams athwart the darkness. A divine hand
was preparing the way for the Great Reformation.
The appeal to men’s reason aroused them from their passive submission to papal dogmas. The Scriptures were received with favor by the higher classes, who alone in that
age possessed a knowledge of letters. Wycliffe now taught
the distinctive doctrines of Protestantism,—salvation
through faith in Christ, and the sole infallibility of the
Scriptures. Many priests joined him in circulating the Bible

Early

Reformers

[83-96]

7 5

and in preaching the gospel; and so great was the effect of
these labors and of Wycliffe’s writings, that the new faith
was accepted by nearly one-half of the people of England.
The kingdom of darkness trembled. Mendicant friars, who
swarmed in England, listened in anger and amazement to his
bold, eloquent utterances. The hatred of Rome was kindled
to greater intensity, and again she plotted to silence the
Reformer’s voice. But the Lord covered with His shield the
messenger of truth. The efforts of his enemies to stop his
work and to destroy his life were alike unsuccessful, and
in his sixty-first year he died in peace in the very service
of the altar.
The doctrines which had been taught by Wycliffe continued for a time to spread; but soon the pitiless storm of
persecution burst upon those who had dared to accept
the Bible as their guide and standard. Martyrdom succeeded martyrdom. The advocates of truth, proscribed and
tortured, could only pour their suffering cries into the ear of
the Lord of Sabaoth. The hunted reformers found shelter as
best they could among the lower classes, preaching in secret
places, and hiding away even in dens and caves. Many bore
fearless witness to the truth in massive dungeons and Lollard
towers.
The papists had failed to work their will with Wycliffe
during his life, and their hatred could not be satisfied while
his body rested quietly in the grave. More than forty years
after his death, his bones were disinterred and publicly
burned, and the ashes were thrown into a neighboring brook.
“The brook,” says an old writer, “did convey his ashes into
Avon, Avon into Severn, Severn into the narrow seas, and
they into the main ocean, and thus the ashes of Wycliffe are
the emblem of his doctrine, which now is dispersed all the
world over.” Little did his enemies realize the significance
of their malicious act.
It was through the writings of Wycliffe that John Huss
of Bohemia was led to renounce many of the errors of
Romanism, and to enter upon the work of reform. Like
Wycliffe, Huss was a noble Christian, a man of learning

76

The

Great

Controversy

and of unswerving devotion to the truth. His appeals to
the Scriptures and his bold denunciations of the scandalous
and immoral lives of the clergy, awakened wide-spread interest, and thousands gladly accepted a purer faith. This excited the ire of pope and prelates, priests and friars, and Huss
was summoned to appear before the Council of Constance to answer to the charge of heresy.
A safe-conduct was granted him by the German emperor, and upon his arrival at Constance he was personally assured by the pope that no injustice should be done
him. In a short time, however, he was placed under arrest, by
order of the pope and cardinals, and thrust into a loathsome
dungeon. Some of the nobles and people of Bohemia addressed to the council earnest protests against this outrage.
The emperor, who was loath to permit the violation of a safeconduct, opposed the proceedings against him. But the enemies of the Reformer were malignant and determined. They
appealed to the emperor’s prejudices, to his fears, to his zeal
for the church. They brought forward arguments of great
length to prove that he was perfectly at liberty not to keep
faith with a heretic; and that the council, being above the
emperor, could free him from his word. Thus they prevailed.
After a long trial, in which he firmly maintained the
truth, Huss was required to choose whether he would
recant his doctrines or suffer death. He chose the martyr’s
fate, and after seeing his books given to the flames, he was
himself burned at the stake. In the presence of the assembled
dignitaries of Church and State, the servant of God had uttered a solemn and faithful protest against the corruptions of
the papal hierarchy. His execution, in shameless violation of
the most solemn and public promise of protection, exhibited
to the whole world the perfidious cruelty of Rome. The enemies of truth, though they knew it not, were furthering the
cause which they sought vainly to destroy.
In the gloom of his dungeon, John Huss had foreseen
the triumph of the true faith. Returning, in his dreams, to
the humble parish where he had preached the gospel, he saw
the pope and his bishops effacing the pictures of Christ which

Early

Reformers

[96-119]

7 7

he had painted on the walls of his chapel. The sight caused
him great distress; but the next day he was filled with joy as
he beheld many artists busily engaged in replacing the figures in greater numbers and brighter colors. When their work
was completed, the painters exclaimed to the immense crowd
surrounding them, “Now let the popes and bishops come!
They shall never efface them more!” Said the Reformer, as
he related his dream, “I am certain that the image of Christ
will never be effaced. They have wished to destroy it, but it
shall be painted in all hearts by much better preachers than
myself.”
Soon after the death of Huss, his faithful friend Jerome,
a man of the same fervent piety and of greater learning,
was also condemned, and he met his fate in the same
manner. So perished God’s faithful light-bearers. But the
light of the truths which they proclaimed,—the light of their
heroic example,—could not be extinguished. As well might
men attempt to turn back the sun in its course, as to prevent
the dawning of that day which was even then breaking upon
the world.
Notwithstanding the rage of persecution, a calm, devout,
earnest, patient protest against the prevailing corruption of
religious faith continued to be uttered after the death of
Wycliffe. Like the believers in apostolic days, many freely
sacrificed their worldly possessions for the cause of Christ.
Those who were permitted to dwell in their homes, gladly
received their brethren who had been banished from home
and kindred. When they too were driven forth, they accepted
the lot of the outcast, and rejoiced that they were permitted
to suffer for the truth’s sake.
Strenuous efforts were made to strengthen and extend the
power of the papacy; but while the popes still claimed to be
Christ’s representatives, their lives were so corrupt as to disgust the people. By the aid of the invention of printing, the
Scriptures were more widely circulated, and many were led
to see that the papal doctrines were not sustained by the word
of God.
When one witness was forced to let fall the torch of

truth, another seized it from his hand, and with undaunted courage held it aloft. The struggle had opened
that was to result in the emancipation, not only of individuals and churches, but of nations. Across the gulf of a
hundred years, men stretched their hands to grasp the hands
of the Lollards of the time of Wycliffe. Under Luther began
the Reformation in Germany; Calvin preached the gospel in
France, Zwingle in Switzerland. The world was awakened
from the slumber of ages, as from land to land were sounded
the magic words, “Religious Liberty.”

Foremost among those who were called to lead the
church from the darkness of popery into the light of a
purer faith, stood Martin Luther. Zealous, ardent, and
devoted, knowing no fear but the fear of God, and acknowledging no foundation for religious faith but the Holy Scriptures, Luther was the man for his time; through him, God
accomplished a great work for the reformation of the
church and the enlightenment of the world.
Like the first heralds of the gospel, Luther sprung from
the ranks of poverty. His early years were spent in the humble
home of a German peasant. By daily toil as a miner, his father earned the means for his education. He intended him for
a lawyer; but God designed to make him a builder in the
great temple that was rising so slowly through the centuries.
Hardship, privation, and severe discipline were the
school in which Infinite Wisdom prepared Luther for the
important mission of his life.
Luther’s father was a man of strong and active mind, and
great force of character, honest, resolute, and straightforward.
He was true to his convictions of duty, let the consequences
be what they might. His sterling good sense led him to re-

gard the monastic system with distrust. He was highly displeased when Luther, without his consent, entered a monastery; and it was two years before the father was reconciled to
his son, and even then his opinions remained the same.
Luther’s parents bestowed great care upon the education and training of their children. They endeavored to
instruct them in the knowledge of God and the practice of
Christian virtues. The father’s prayer often ascended in the
hearing of his son, that the child might remember the name
of the Lord, and one day aid in the advancement of his truth.
Every advantage for moral or intellectual culture which their
life of toil permitted them to enjoy, was eagerly improved by
these parents. Their efforts were earnest and persevering
to prepare their children for a life of piety and usefulness. With their firmness and strength of character they sometimes exercised too great severity; but the Reformer himself, though conscious that in some respects they had erred,
found in their discipline more to approve than to condemn.
At school, where he was sent at an early age, Luther was
treated with harshness and even violence. So great was the
poverty of his parents, that for a time he was obliged to obtain his food by singing from door to door, and he often suffered from hunger. The gloomy, superstitious ideas of religion then prevailing filled him with fear. He would lie
down at night with a sorrowful heart, looking forward with
trembling to the dark future, and in constant terror at the
thought of God as a stern, unrelenting judge, a cruel tyrant,
rather than a kind heavenly Father. Yet under so many and
so great discouragements, Luther pressed resolutely forward

chapter covers the period of time between November 10, 1483 and
January 2, 1521—the first 37 years of Martin Luther’s life. He entered Erfert University in 1501, received his Master’s degree in 1505,
traveled to Rome in 1510, received his Doctor of Theology in 1512,
and began preaching. Luther nailed the 95 theses to the Castle Church
door on October 31, 1517. Two years later, Tetzel died. Phillip
Melanchthon arrived in 1518. Luther’s trial at Augsburg occurred in
October 1518. Two years later, Pope Leo X’s bull condemned Luther.

toward the high standard of moral and intellectual excellence
which he had determined to attain.
He thirsted for knowledge, and the earnest and practical
character of his mind led him to desire the solid and useful
rather than the showy and superficial. When, at the age of
eighteen, he entered the University of Erfurth, his situation was more favorable and his prospects brighter than in
his earlier years. His parents having by thrift and industry
acquired a competence, they were able to render him all
needed assistance. And the influence of judicious friends had
somewhat lessened the gloomy effects of his former training. He now diligently applied himself to the study of the
best authors, enriching his understanding with their most
weighty thoughts, and making the wisdom of the wise his
own. A retentive memory, a vivid imagination, strong reasoning powers, and energetic application to study, soon
won for him the foremost rank among his associates.
The fear of the Lord dwelt in the heart of Luther, enabling
him to maintain his steadfastness of purpose, and leading
him to deep humility before God. He had an abiding sense
of his dependence upon divine aid, and he did not fail to
begin each day with prayer, while his heart was continually breathing a petition for guidance and support. “To
pray well,” he often said, “is the better half of study.”
While one day examining the books in the library of
the university, Luther discovered a Latin Bible. He had
before heard fragments of the Gospels and Epistles at public
worship, and he thought that they were the whole of God’s
word. Now, for the first time, he looked upon the whole Bible.
With mingled awe and wonder he turned the sacred
pages; with quickened pulse and throbbing heart he read for
himself the words of life, pausing now and then to exclaim,
“Oh, if God would give me such a book for my own!” Angels of Heaven were by his side, and rays of light from the
throne of God revealed the treasures of truth to his understanding. He had ever feared to offend God, but now the
deep conviction of his condition as a sinner took hold upon
him as never before.

82

The

Great

Controversy

An earnest desire to be free from sin and to find peace
with God, led him at last to enter a cloister, and devote
himself to a monastic life. Here he was required to perform
the lowest drudgery, and to beg from house to house. He was
at an age when respect and appreciation are most eagerly
craved, and these menial offices were deeply mortifying to
his natural feelings; but he patiently endured this humiliation, believing that it was necessary because of his sins.
Every moment that could be spared from his daily duties,
he employed in study, robbing himself of sleep, and grudging even the moments spent at his humble meals. Above
everything else he delighted in the study of God’s word.
He had found a Bible chained to the convent wall, and to
this he often repaired. As his convictions of sin deepened,
he sought by his own works to obtain pardon and peace. He
led a most rigorous life, endeavoring to crucify the flesh by
fastings, watchings, and scourgings. He shrank from no sacrifice to become holy and gain Heaven. As the result of this
painful discipline, he lost strength, and suffered from fainting spasms, from the effects of which he never fully recovered. But with all his efforts, his burdened soul found no
relief. He was at last driven to the verge of despair.
When it appeared to Luther that all was lost, God raised
up a friend and helper for him. The pious Staupitz opened
the word of God to Luther’s mind, and bade him look
away from himself, cease the contemplation of infinite punishment for the violation of God’s law, and look to Jesus, his
sin-pardoning Saviour. “Instead of torturing yourself on
account of your sins, cast yourself into the arms of your
Redeemer. Trust in Him,—in the righteousness of His life,—
in the atonement of His death. Listen to the Son of God. He
became man to give you the assurance of divine favor. Love
Him who has first loved you.” Thus spoke this messenger of
mercy. His words made a deep impression upon Luther’s
mind. After many a struggle with long-cherished errors, he
was enabled to grasp the truth, and peace came to his troubled
soul.
Luther was ordained a priest, and was called from

the cloister to a professorship in the University of
Wittemberg. Here he applied himself to the study of the
Scriptures in the original tongues. He began to lecture upon
the Bible; and the book of Psalms, the Gospels, and the
Epistles were opened to the understanding of crowds of delighted listeners. Staupitz, his friend and superior, urged him
to ascend the pulpit, and preach the word of God. Luther
hesitated, feeling himself unworthy to speak to the people in
Christ’s stead. It was only after a long struggle that he yielded
to the solicitations of his friends. Already he was mighty in
the Scriptures, and the grace of God rested upon him. His
eloquence captivated his hearers, the clearness and power
with which he presented the truth convinced their understanding, and his deep fervor touched their hearts.
Luther was still a true son of the papal church, and
had no thought that he would ever be anything else. In
the providence of God he decided to visit Rome. He pursued his journey on foot, lodging at the monasteries on the
way. At a convent in Italy he was filled with wonder as he
saw the splendor of the apartments, the richness of the
dresses, the luxury of the table, the extravagance everywhere.
With painful misgivings he contrasted this scene with the
self-denial and hardship of his own life. His mind was becoming perplexed.
At last he beheld in the distance the seven-hilled city. With
deep emotion he prostrated himself upon the earth, exclaiming, “Holy Rome, I salute thee!” He entered the city, visited
the churches, listened to the marvelous tales repeated by
priests and monks, and performed all the ceremonies required.
Everywhere he looked upon scenes that filled him with
astonishment and horror. He saw that iniquity existed
among all classes of the clergy. He heard indecent jokes from
prelates, and was filled with horror at their awful profanity,
even during mass. As he mingled with the monks and citizens, he met dissipation, debauchery. Turn where he would,
in the place of sanctity he found profanation. “It is incredible,” he wrote, “what sins and atrocities are committed
in Rome.” “If there be a hell, Rome is built above it. It is

84

The

Great

Controversy

an abyss whence all sins proceed.”
An indulgence had been promised by the pope to all who
should ascend on their knees what was known as Pilate’s
staircase. Luther was one day performing this act, when suddenly a voice like thunder seemed to say to him, “The just
shall live by faith!” He sprung upon his feet in shame and
horror, and fled from the scene of his folly. That text never
lost its power upon his soul. From that time he saw more
clearly than ever before the fallacy of trusting to human works
for salvation, and the necessity of constant faith in the merits of Christ. His eyes had been opened, and were never
again to be closed, to the Satanic delusions of the papacy. When he turned his face from Rome, he had turned
away also in heart, and from that time the separation grew
wider, until he severed all connection with the papal
church.
After his return from Rome, Luther received at the University of Wittemberg the degree of doctor of divinity. Now
he was at liberty to devote himself, as never before, to the
Scriptures that he loved. He had taken a solemn vow to study
carefully and to preach with fidelity the word of God, not the
sayings and doctrines of the popes, all the days of his life.
He was no longer the mere monk or professor, but the
authorized herald of the Bible. He had been called as a
shepherd to feed the flock of God, that were hungering
and thirsting for the truth. He firmly declared that Christians
should receive no other doctrines than those which rest on
the authority of the Sacred Scriptures. These words struck at
the very foundation of papal supremacy. They contained the
vital principle of the Reformation.
Luther saw the danger of exalting human theories above
the word of God. He fearlessly attacked the speculative infidelity of the schoolmen, and opposed the philosophy and
theology which had so long held a controlling influence upon
the people. He denounced such studies as not only worthless
but pernicious, and sought to turn the minds of his hearers
from the sophistries of philosophers and theologians to the
eternal truths set forth by prophets and apostles.

Precious was the message which he bore to the eager
crowds that hung upon his words. Never before had such
teachings fallen upon their ears. The glad tidings of a
Saviour’s love, the assurance of pardon and peace through
His atoning blood, rejoiced their hearts, and inspired within
them an immortal hope. At Wittemberg a light was kindled
whose rays should extend to the uttermost parts of the earth,
and which was to increase in brightness to the close of time.
But light and darkness cannot harmonize. Between
truth and error there is an irrepressible conflict. To uphold and defend the one is to attack and overthrow the
other. Our Saviour Himself declared, “I came not to send
peace, but a sword.” Matthew 10:34. Said Luther, a few years
after the opening of the Reformation, “God does not conduct, but drives me forward. I am not master of my own
actions. I would gladly live in repose, but I am thrown into
the midst of tumults and revolutions.” He was now about to
be urged into the contest.
The Roman Church had made merchandise of the grace
of God. The tables of the money-changers were set up beside her altars, and the air resounded with the shouts of buyers and sellers. Under the plea of raising funds for the
erection of St. Peter’s church at Rome, indulgences for
sin were publicly offered for sale by the authority of the
pope. By the price of crime a temple was to be built up for
God’s worship,—the corner-stone laid with the wages of iniquity. But the very means of Rome’s aggrandizement provoked the deadliest blow to her power and greatness. It was
this that aroused the most determined and successful of the
enemies of popery, and led to the battle which shook the
papal throne to its foundation, and jostled the triple crown
upon the pontiff’s head.
The official appointed to conduct the sale of indulgences in Germany—Tetzel by name—had been convicted of the basest offenses against society and against
the law of God; but having escaped the punishment due to
his crimes, he was employed to further the mercenary and
unscrupulous projects of the Romish Church. With great ef-

86

The

Controversy

frontery he repeated the most glaring falsehoods, and related
marvelous tales to deceive an ignorant, credulous, and superstitious people. Had they possessed the word of God, they
would not have been thus deceived. It was to keep them under the control of the papacy, that they might swell the power
and wealth of her ambitious leaders, that the Bible had been
withheld from them.
As Tetzel entered a town, a messenger went before him,
announcing, “The grace of God and of the holy father is at
your gates.” And the people welcomed the blasphemous pretender as if he were God Himself come down from Heaven
to them. The infamous traffic was set up in the church, and
Tetzel, ascending the pulpit, extolled indulgences as the most
precious gift of God. He declared that by virtue of his certificates of pardon, all the sins which the purchaser should
afterward desire to commit would be forgiven him, and that
even repentance was not indispensable. More than this, he
assured his hearers that the indulgences had power to save
not only the living but the dead; that the very moment the
money should clink against the bottom of his chest, the soul
in whose behalf it had been paid would escape from purgatory and make its way to Heaven.
When Simon Magus offered to purchase of the apostles
the power to work miracles, Peter answered him, “Thy money
perish with thee, because thou hast thought that the gift of
God may be purchased with money.” Acts 8:20. But Tetzel’s
offer was grasped by eager thousands. Gold and silver flowed
into his treasury. A salvation that could be bought with money
was more easily obtained than that which requires repentance, faith, and diligent effort to resist and overcome sin.
The doctrine of indulgences had been opposed by men
of learning and piety in the Romish Church, and there
were many who had no faith in pretensions so contrary
to both reason and revelation. Yet no bishop dared lift
his voice against the fraud and corruption of this iniquitous traffic. The minds of men were becoming disturbed and
uneasy, and many eagerly inquired if God would not work
through some instrumentality for the purification of His

Luther’s

[127-129]

8 7

church.
Luther, though still a papist of the straitest sort, was
filled with horror at the blasphemous assumptions of the
indulgence-mongers. Many of his own congregation had
purchased certificates of pardon, and they soon began to come
to their pastor, confessing their various sins, and expecting
absolution, not because they were penitent and wished to
reform, but on the ground of the indulgence. Luther refused
them absolution, and warned them that unless they should
repent, and reform their lives, they must perish in their sins.
In great perplexity they sought out Tetzel, and informed him
that an Augustine monk had treated his letters with contempt.
The friar was filled with rage. He uttered the most terrible
curses, caused fires to be lighted in the public square, and
declared that he had orders from the pope to burn the heretics who dared oppose his most holy indulgences.
Luther now entered boldly upon his work as a champion of the truth. His voice was heard from the pulpit in
earnest, solemn warning. He set before the people the offensive character of sin, and taught them that it is impossible for man, by his own works, to lessen its guilt or evade
its punishment. Nothing but repentance toward God and faith
in Christ can save the sinner. The grace of Christ cannot be
purchased; it is a free gift. He counseled the people not to
buy the indulgences, but to look in faith to a crucified Redeemer. He related his own painful experience in vainly seeking by humiliation and penance to secure salvation, and assured his hearers that it was by looking away from himself
and believing in Christ that he found peace and joy.
As Tetzel continued his traffic and his impious pretensions, Luther determined upon a more effectual protest
against these crying abuses. The festival of All-Saints was
an important day for Wittemberg. The costly relics of the
church were then displayed, and remission of sin was granted
to all who visited the church and made confession. Accordingly on this day the people in great numbers resorted thither.
On the day preceding the festival, Luther went boldly to
the church, to which crowds of worshipers were already

88

The

Great

Controversy

repairing, and affixed to the door ninety-five propositions against the doctrine of indulgences. These theses he
declared himself ready to defend against all opposers.
His propositions attracted universal attention. They were
read and re-read and repeated in every direction. Great excitement was created in the university and in the whole city.
By these theses it was shown that the power to grant the
pardon of sin, and to remit its penalty, had never been committed to the pope or to any other man. The whole scheme
was a farce,—an artifice to extort money by playing upon
the superstitions of the people,—a device of Satan to destroy the souls of all who should trust to its lying pretensions. It was also clearly shown that the gospel of Christ is
the most valuable treasure of the church, and that the grace
of God, therein revealed, is freely bestowed upon all who
seek it by repentance and faith.
Luther’s theses challenged discussion; but no one
dared accept the challenge. The questions which he proposed had in a few days spread through all Germany,
and in a few weeks they had sounded throughout Christendom. Many devoted Romanists, who had seen and lamented the terrible iniquity prevailing in the church, but had
not known how to arrest its progress, read the propositions
with great joy, recognizing in them the voice of God. They
felt that the Lord had graciously set His hand to arrest the
rapidly swelling tide of corruption that was issuing from the
see of Rome. Princes and magistrates secretly rejoiced that a
check was to be put upon the arrogant power from which
there was no appeal.
But the sin-loving and superstitious multitudes were terrified as the sophistries that had soothed their fears were
swept away. Crafty ecclesiastics, interrupted in their work
of sanctioning crime, and seeing their gains endangered,
were enraged, and rallied to uphold their pretensions.
The Reformer had bitter accusers to meet. Some charged him
with acting hastily and from impulse. Others accused him of
presumption, declaring that he was not directed of God, but
was acting from pride and forwardness. “Who does not

Luther’s

Separation

from

Rome

[129-131]

8 9

know,” he responded, “that one can seldom advance a new
idea without having some appearance of pride, and without
being accused of exciting quarrels? Why were Christ and all
the martyrs put to death?—Because they appeared proud
despisers of the wisdom of the times in which they lived,
and because they brought forward new truths without having first consulted the oracles of the old opinions.”
Again he declared: “What I am doing will not be effected
by the prudence of man, but by the counsel of God. If the
work be of God, who shall stop it? If it be not, who shall
forward it? Not my will, not theirs, not ours, but Thy will,
holy Father who art in Heaven!”
Though Luther had been moved by the Spirit of God
to begin his work, he was not to carry it forward without severe conflicts. The reproaches of his enemies, their
misrepresentation of his purposes, and their unjust and malicious reflections upon his character and motives, came in
upon him like an overwhelming flood; and they were not
without effect. He had felt confident that the leaders in the
church and the philosophers of the nation, would gladly unite
with him in efforts for reform. Words of encouragement from
those in high position had inspired him with joy and hope.
Already in anticipation he had seen a brighter day dawning
for the church. But encouragement had changed to reproach
and condemnation. Many dignitaries, both of Church and
State, were convicted of the truthfulness of his theses;
but they soon saw that the acceptance of these truths
would involve great changes. To enlighten and reform the
people would be virtually to undermine the papal authority,
to stop thousands of streams now flowing into her treasury,
and thus greatly to curtail the extravagance and luxury of
the Romish leaders. Furthermore, to teach the people to think
and act as responsible beings, looking to Christ alone for
salvation, would overthrow the pontiff’s throne, and eventually destroy their own authority. For this reason they refused
the knowledge tendered them of God, and arrayed themselves
against Christ and the truth by their opposition to the man
whom He had sent to enlighten them.

90

The

Great

Controversy

Luther trembled as he looked upon himself,—one man
opposed to the mightiest powers of earth. He sometimes
doubted whether he had indeed been led of God to set himself against the authority of the church. “Who was I,” he
writes, “to oppose the majesty of the pope, before whom the
kings of the earth and the whole world trembled?” “No one
can know what I suffered in those first two years, and into
what dejection and even despair I was sunk.” But he was not
left to become utterly disheartened. When human support
failed, he looked to God alone, and learned that he could
lean in perfect safety upon that all-powerful arm.
To a friend of the Reformation Luther wrote: “We cannot
attain to the understanding of Scripture either by study or
strength of intellect. Therefore your first duty must be to
begin with prayer. Entreat the Lord to deign to grant you, in
His rich mercy, rightly to understand His word. There is no
other interpreter of the word but the Author of that word
Himself. Even as He has said, ‘They shall be all taught of
God.’ Hope nothing from your study and strength of intellect; but simply put your trust in God, and in the guidance of
His Spirit. Believe one who has made trial of this matter.”
Here is a lesson of vital importance to those who feel that
God has called them to present to others the solemn truths
for this time. These truths will stir the enmity of Satan, and
of men who love the fables that he has devised. In the conflict with the powers of evil, there is need of something more
than intellect and human wisdom.
When enemies appealed to custom and tradition, or
to the assertions and authority of the pope, Luther met
them with the Bible and the Bible alone. Here were arguments which they could not answer; therefore the slaves of
formalism and superstition clamored for his blood, as the
Jews had clamored for the blood of Christ. “He is a heretic,”
cried the Roman zealots; “it is a sin to allow him to live an
hour longer! Away with him at once to the scaffold!” But
Luther did not fall a prey to their fury. God had a work for
him to do, and angels of Heaven were sent to protect him.
Many, however, who had received from Luther the precious

Luther’s

Separation

Rome

[132-134]

9 1

light, were made the objects of Satan’s wrath, and for the
truth’s sake fearlessly suffered torture and death.
Luther’s teachings attracted the attention of thoughtful minds throughout all Germany. From his sermons and
writings issued beams of light which awakened and illuminated thousands. A living faith was taking the place of the
dead formalism in which the church had so long been held.
The people were daily losing confidence in the superstitions
of Romanism. The barriers of prejudice were giving way.
The word of God, by which Luther tested every doctrine and
every claim, was like a two-edged sword, cutting its way to
the hearts of the people. Everywhere there was awakening a
desire for spiritual progress. Everywhere was such a hungering and thirsting after righteousness as had not been
known for ages. The eyes of the people, so long directed to
human rites and human mediators, were now turning, in penitence and faith, to Christ and Him crucified.
This wide-spread interest aroused still further the fears of
the papal authorities. Luther received a summons to appear at Rome to answer to the charge of heresy. The command filled his friends with terror. They knew full well the
danger that threatened him in that corrupt city, already drunk
with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus. They protested
against his going to Rome, and requested that he receive
his examination in Germany.
This arrangement was finally effected, and the pope’s
legate was appointed to hear the case. In the instructions
communicated by the pontiff to this official, it was stated
that Luther had already been declared a heretic. The legate
was therefore charged to prosecute and reduce him to submission without delay. If he should remain steadfast, and the
legate should fail to gain possession of his person, he was
empowered to proscribe him in all places in Germany, to put
away, curse, and excommunicate all who were attached to
him. And further, the pope called upon his legate, in order
entirely to root out the pestilent heresy, to excommunicate
all, of whatever dignity in Church or State, except the emperor, who should neglect to seize Luther and his adherents,

92

The

Great

Controversy

and deliver them up to suffer the vengeance of Rome.
Here is displayed the true spirit of popery. Not a trace of
Christian principle, or even of common justice, is to be seen
in the whole document. Luther was at a great distance from
Rome; he had had no opportunity to explain or defend his
position; yet before his case had been investigated, he was
summarily pronounced a heretic, and in the same day, exhorted, accused, judged, and condemned; and all this by the
self-styled holy father, the only supreme, infallible authority
in Church or State!
Augsburg had been fixed upon as the place of trial,
and the Reformer set out on foot to perform the journey
thither. Serious fears were entertained in his behalf. Threats
had been made openly that he would be waylaid and murdered on the way, and his friends begged him not to venture.
They even entreated him to leave Wittemberg for a time, and
find safety with those who would gladly protect him. But he
would not leave the position where God had placed him. He
must continue faithfully to maintain the truth, notwithstanding the storms that were beating upon him. His language
was: “I am like Jeremiah, a man of strife and contention; but
the more they increase their threatenings, the more they multiply my joy. . . . They have already torn to pieces my honor
and my good name. All I have left is my wretched body; let
them have it; they will then shorten my life by a few hours.
But as to my soul, they shall not have that. He who resolves
to bear the word of Christ to the world, must expect death at
every hour.”
The tidings of Luther’s arrival at Augsburg gave great
satisfaction to the papal legate. The troublesome heretic
who was exciting the attention of the whole world seemed
now in the power of Rome, and the legate determined that he
should not leave the city as he had entered. The Reformer
had failed to provide himself with a safe-conduct. His friends
urged him not to appear before the legate without one, and
they themselves undertook to procure it from the emperor.
The legate intended to force Luther, if possible, to retract,
or, failing in this, to cause him to be conveyed to Rome, to

Luther’s

[134-137]

share the fate of Huss and Jerome. Therefore through his
agents he endeavored to induce Luther to appear without a
safe-conduct, trusting himself to his mercy. This the Reformer
firmly declined to do. Not until he had received the document pledging him the emperor’s protection, did he appear
in the presence of the papal ambassador.
As a matter of policy, the Romanists had decided to
attempt to win Luther by an appearance of gentleness.
The legate, in his interviews with him, professed great friendliness; but he demanded that Luther submit implicitly to the
authority of the church, and yield every point without argument or question. He had not rightly estimated the character
of the man with whom he had to deal. Luther, in reply, expressed his regard for the church, his desire for the truth, his
readiness to answer all objections to what he had taught, and
to submit his doctrines to the decision of certain leading universities. But at the same time he protested against the
cardinal’s course in requiring him to retract without having
proved him in error.
The only response was, “Recant, recant.” The Reformer
showed that his position was sustained by the Scriptures,
and firmly declared that he could not renounce the truth.
When the prelate saw that Luther’s reasoning was unanswerable, he lost all self-control, and in a rage cried
out: “Retract, or I will send you to Rome, there to appear
before the judges commissioned to take cognizance of your
case. I will excommunicate you and all your partisans, and
all who shall at any time countenance you, and will cast them
out of the church.” And he finally declared, in a haughty and
angry tone, “Retract, or return no more.”
The Reformer retired with his friends, leaving the cardinal and his supporters to look at one another in utter confusion at the unexpected result of the conference.
Luther’s efforts on this occasion were not without good
results. The large assembly present had opportunity to compare the two men, and to judge for themselves of the spirit
manifested by them, as well as of the strength and truthfulness of their positions. How marked the contrast! The Re-

94

former, simple, humble, firm, stood up in the strength of God,
having truth on his side; the pope’s representative, self-important, overbearing, haughty, and unreasonable, was without a single argument from the Scriptures yet vehemently
crying, “Retract, or be sent to Rome for punishment.”
Notwithstanding Luther had secured a safe-conduct,
the Romanists were plotting to seize and imprison him.
His friends urged that as it was useless for him to prolong
his stay, he should return to Wittemberg without delay, and
that the utmost caution should be observed in order to conceal his intentions. He accordingly left Augsburg before
daybreak, on horseback, accompanied only by a guide furnished him by the magistrate. With many forebodings he
secretly made his way through the dark and silent streets of
the city. Enemies, vigilant and cruel, were plotting his destruction. Would he escape the snares prepared for him?
Those were moments of anxiety and earnest prayer. He
reached a small gate in the wall of the city. It was opened for
him, and with his guide he passed through without hindrance.
Once beyond the limits, he soon left the city far behind. Satan and his emissaries were defeated. The man whom they
had thought in their power was gone, escaped as a bird from
the snare of the fowler.
At the news of Luther’s departure, the legate was overwhelmed with surprise and anger. He had expected to receive great honor for his wisdom and firmness in dealing
with this disturber of the church; but his hope was disappointed. He gave expression to his wrath in a letter to
Frederick, the elector of Saxony, bitterly denouncing Luther,
and demanding that Frederick send the Reformer to Rome
or banish him from Saxony.
In defense, Luther urged that the legate or the pope show
him his errors from the Scriptures, and pledged himself in
the most solemn manner to renounce his doctrines if they
could be shown to contradict the word of God. And he expressed his gratitude to God that he had been counted worthy to suffer in so holy a cause. These words made a deep
impression upon the elector, and he resolved to stand as

Luther’s

Separation

from

Rome

[137-140]

9 5

Luther’s protector. He refused to send him to Rome, or to
expel him from his territories.
The elector saw that there was a general breaking down
of the moral restraints of society. A great work of reform
was needed. The complicated and expensive arrangements
to restrain and punish crime would be unnecessary if
men but acknowledged and obeyed the requirements of
God and the dictates of an enlightened conscience. He saw
that Luther was laboring to secure this object, and he secretly rejoiced that a better influence was making itself felt
in the church.
He saw also that as a professor in the university, Luther
was eminently successful. From all parts of Germany, students crowded to Wittemberg to listen to his teachings. Young
men, coming in sight of the city for the first time, would
raise their hands toward heaven, and thank God that he had
caused the light of his truth to shine forth from that place as
in former ages from Jerusalem.
Luther was as yet but partially converted from the
errors of Romanism. But as he compared the holy oracles
with the papal decrees and constitutions, he was filled
with wonder. “I am reading,” he wrote, “the decretals of the
popes, and . . . I know not whether the pope is antichrist
himself, or whether he is his apostle, so misrepresented and
even crucified does Christ appear in them.” Yet at this time
Luther was still a supporter of the Roman Church, and had
no thought that he would ever separate from her communion.
The Reformer’s writings and his doctrine were extending to every nation in Christendom. The work spread to
Switzerland and Holland. Copies of his writings found their
way to France and Spain. In England his teachings were received as the word of life. To Belgium and Italy also the
truth had extended. Thousands were awakening from their
deathlike stupor to the joy and hope of a life of faith.
Rome became more and more exasperated by the attacks
of Luther, and it was secretly declared by some of his fanatical opponents, that he who should take his life would be

Controversy

without sin. One day a stranger, with a pistol concealed under his cloak, approached the Reformer, and inquired why
he went thus alone. “I am in the hands of God,” answered
Luther. “He is my help and my shield. What can men do
unto me?” Upon hearing these words, the stranger turned
pale, and fled away, as from the presence of the angels of
Heaven.
Rome was bent upon the destruction of Luther; but
God was his defense. His doctrines were heard everywhere,—in convents, in cottages, in the castles of the nobles,
in the universities, in the palaces of kings; and noble men
were rising on every hand to sustain his efforts.
In an appeal to the emperor and nobility of Germany in
behalf of the Reformation of Christianity, Luther wrote concerning the pope: “It is monstrous to see him who is called
the vicar of Christ, displaying a magnificence unrivaled by
that of any emperor. Is this to represent the poor and lowly
Jesus or the humble St. Peter? The pope, say they, is the lord
of the world! But Christ, whose vicar he boasts of being,
said, ‘My kingdom is not of this world.’ Can the dominions
of a vicar extend beyond those of his superior?”
He wrote thus of the universities: “I fear much that the
universities will be found to be great gates leading down to
hell, unless they take diligent care to explain the Holy Scriptures, and to engrave them in the hearts of youth. I advise no
one to place his child where the Holy Scriptures are not regarded as the rule of life. Every institution where the word
of God is not diligently studied, must become corrupt.”
This appeal was rapidly circulated throughout Germany,
and exerted a powerful influence upon the people. The whole
nation was roused to rally around the standard of reform.
Luther’s opponents, burning with a desire for revenge, urged
the pope to take decisive measures against him. It was decreed that his doctrines should be condemned immediately.
Sixty days were granted the Reformer and his adherents, after which, if they did not recant, they were all to
be excommunicated.
That was a terrible crisis for the Reformation. For centu-

ries Rome’s sentence of excommunication had been swiftly
followed by the stroke of death. Luther was not blind to the
tempest about to burst upon him; but he stood firm, trusting
in Christ to be his support and shield. With a martyr’s faith
and courage he wrote: “What is about to happen I know not,
and I care not to know.” “Wherever the blow may reach me,
I fear not. Not so much as a leaf falls without the will of our
Father; how much rather will He care for us! It is a little
matter to die for the Word, since His Word, that was made
flesh for us, hath Himself died. If we die with Him, we shall
live with Him; and, passing through that which He has passed
through before us, we shall be where He is, and dwell with
Him forever.”
When the papal bull reached Luther, he said: “I despise it, and resist it, as impious and false. It is Christ Himself who is condemned therein.” “I glory in the prospect of
suffering for the best of causes. Already I feel greater liberty; for I know now that the pope is antichrist, and that his
throne is that of Satan himself.”
Yet the word of the pontiff of Rome still had power. Prison,
torture, and sword were weapons potent to enforce submission. Everything seemed to indicate that the Reformer’s work
was about to close. The weak and superstitious trembled before the decree of the pope, and while there was general sympathy for Luther, many felt that life was too dear to be risked
in the cause of reform.
But Luther proceeded to publicly burn the pope’s bull,
with the canon laws, the decretals, and certain writings sustaining the papal power. By this action he boldly declared
his final separation from the Roman Church. He accepted
his excommunication, and proclaimed to the world that between himself and the pope there must hereafter be war. The
great contest was now fully entered upon. Soon after, a new
bull appeared, and the excommunication which had before
been threatened, was finally pronounced against the Reformer
and all who should receive his doctrines.
Opposition is the lot of all whom God employs to present
truths specially applicable to their time. There was a present

truth,—a truth at that time of special importance,—in the
days of Luther; there is a present truth for the church to-day.
But truth is no more desired by the majority to-day than it
was by the papists who opposed Luther. There is the same
disposition to accept the theories and traditions of men for
the word of God as in former ages. Those who present truth
for this time should not expect to be received with greater
favor than were earlier reformers. The great controversy
between truth and error, between Christ and Satan, is to
increase in intensity to the close of this world’s history.

———————————————————————

A new emperor, Charles the Fifth, had ascended the
throne of Germany, and the emissaries of Rome hastened
to present their congratulations, and induce the monarch to employ his power against the Reformation. On
the other hand, the Elector of Saxony, to whom Charles was
in great degree indebted for his crown, entreated him to take
no step against Luther until he should have granted him a
hearing. The emperor was thus placed in a position of great
perplexity and embarrassment. The papists would be satisfied with nothing short of an imperial edict sentencing Luther
to death. The elector had declared firmly that neither his imperial majesty nor any one else had yet made it appear to
him that the Reformer’s writings had been refuted; therefore
he requested that Doctor Luther be furnished with a safeconduct, so that he might answer for himself before a tribunal of learned, pious, and impartial judges.
The attention of all parties was now directed to the
assembly of the German States which convened at Worms
soon after the accession of Charles to the empire. There
were important political questions and interests to be con-

Luther

Diet

[145-147]

101

sidered by this national council; but these appeared of little
moment when contrasted with the cause of the monk of
Wittemberg.
Charles had previously directed the elector to bring Luther
with him to the Diet, assuring him that the Reformer should
be protected from all violence, and should be allowed a free
conference with one competent to discuss the disputed points.
Luther was anxious to appear before the emperor. His health
was at this time much impaired; yet he wrote to the elector:
“If I cannot perform the journey to Worms in good health, I
will be carried there, sick as I am. For, since the emperor has
summoned me, I cannot doubt that it is the call of God Himself. If they intend to use violence against me, as they probably do, for assuredly it is with no view of gaining information that they require me to appear before them, I place the
matter in the Lord’s hands. He still lives and reigns who preserved the three Israelites in the fiery furnace. If it be not His
will to save me, my life is of little consequence. Let us only
take care that the gospel be not exposed to the scorn of the
ungodly, and let us shed our blood in its defense rather than
allow them to triumph. Who shall say whether my life or my
death would contribute most to the salvation of my brethren?” “Expect anything from me but flight or recantation.
Fly I cannot; still less can I recant.”
As the news was circulated at Worms that Luther was
to appear before the Diet, a general excitement was created. Aleander, the papal legate to whom his case had been
specially intrusted, was alarmed and enraged. He saw that
the result would be disastrous to the papal cause. To institute inquiry into a case in which the pope had already pronounced sentence of condemnation, would be to cast contempt upon the authority of the sovereign pontiff. Further———————————
ATING OF THIS CHAPTER—
DA
CHAPTER—Charles V (1500HISTORICAL D
1558), the new emperor, was only 21 when he convened the Diet [Council] of Worms. Meeting in November 1520, Luther appeared before it
on April 17, 1521, and gave his defense the next day. After being
secretly taken to the Wartburg Castle, he began translating the New
Testament in December. It was published in September 1522.

102

The

Controversy

more, he was apprehensive that the eloquent and powerful
arguments of this man might turn away many of the princes
from the cause of the pope. He therefore, in the most urgent
manner, remonstrated with Charles against Luther’s appearance at Worms. He warned, entreated, and threatened, until
the emperor yielded, and wrote to the elector that if Luther
would not retract, he must remain at Wittemberg.
Not content with this victory, Aleander labored with all
the power and cunning at his command to secure
Luther’s condemnation. With a persistence worthy of a
better cause, he urged the matter upon the attention of princes,
prelates, and other members of the assembly, accusing the
Reformer of sedition, rebellion, impiety, and blasphemy. But
the vehemence and passion manifested by the legate plainly
revealed that he was actuated by hatred and revenge rather
than by zeal for religion. It was the prevailing sentiment of
the assembly that Luther was innocent.
With redoubled zeal, Aleander urged upon the emperor the duty of executing the papal edicts. Overcome at
last by this importunity, Charles bade the legate present his
case to the Diet. Rome had few advocates better fitted, by
nature and education, to defend her cause. The friends of the
Reformer looked forward with some anxiety to the result of
Aleander’s speech.
There was no little excitement when the legate, with
great dignity and pomp, appeared before the national
assembly. Many called to mind the scene of our Saviour’s
trial, when Annas and Caiaphas, before the judgment-seat
of Pilate, demanded the death of Him “that perverted the
people.”
With all the power of learning and eloquence, Aleander
set himself to overthrow the truth. Charge after charge he
hurled against Luther as an enemy of the Church and the
State, the living and the dead, clergy and laity, councils and
private Christians. “There is enough in the errors of
Luther,” he declared, “to warrant the burning of a hundred thousand heretics.”
In conclusion, he endeavored to cast contempt upon the

Luther before the Diet

[147-149]

103

adherents of the reformed faith: “What are all these
Lutherans?—A motley rabble of insolent grammarians, corrupt priests, dissolute monks, ignorant lawyers, and degraded
nobles, with the common people whom they have misled and
perverted. How greatly superior is the Catholic party in numbers, intelligence, and power! A unanimous decree from this
illustrious assembly will open the eyes of the simple, show
the unwary their danger, determine the wavering, and
strengthen the weak-hearted.”
With such weapons have the advocates of truth in every
age been attacked. The same arguments are still urged against
all who dare to present, in opposition to established errors,
the plain and direct teachings of God’s word. “Who are these
preachers of new doctrines?” exclaim those who desire a
popular religion. “They are unlearned, few in numbers, and
of the poorer class. Yet they claim to have the truth, and to
be the chosen people of God. They are ignorant and deceived.
How greatly superior in numbers and influence are our denominations! How many great and learned men are in our
churches! How much more power is on our side!” These are
the arguments that have a telling influence upon the world;
but they are no more conclusive now than in the days of the
Reformer.
The Reformation did not, as many suppose, end with
Luther. It is to be continued to the close of this world’s
history. Luther had a great work to do in reflecting to
others the light which God had permitted to shine upon
him; yet he did not receive all the light which was to be
given to the world. From that time to this, new light has
been continually shining upon the Scriptures, and new truths
have been constantly unfolding.
The legate’s address made a deep impression upon
the Diet. There was no Luther present, with the clear and
convincing truths of God’s word, to vanquish the papal champion. No attempt was made to defend the Reformer. There
was manifest a general impulse to root out the Lutheran heresy from the empire. Rome had enjoyed the most favorable
opportunity to defend her cause. The greatest of her orators

104

The

Great

Controversy

had spoken. All that she could say in her own vindication
had been said. But the apparent victory was the signal of
defeat. Henceforth the contrast between truth and error would
be more clearly seen, as they should take the field in open
warfare. Never from that day would Rome stand as secure
as she had stood.
The majority of the assembly were ready to sacrifice Luther
to the demands of the pope; but many of them saw and deplored the existing depravity in the church, and desired a
suppression of the abuses suffered by the German people in
consequence of Rome’s corruption and greed of gain. The
legate had presented the papal rule in the most favorable light. Now the Lord moved upon a member of the
Diet to give a true delineation of the effects of papal tyranny. With noble firmness, Duke George of Saxony stood
up in that princely assembly, and specified with terrible exactness the deceptions and abominations of popery, and their
dire results. In closing he said:
“These are but a few of the abuses which cry out against
Rome for redress. All shame is laid aside, and one object
alone incessantly pursued: money! evermore money! so that
the very men whose duty it is to teach the truth, utter nothing
but falsehoods, and are not only tolerated but rewarded; because the greater their lies, the greater are their gains. This is
the foul source from which so many corrupt streams flow
out on every side. Profligacy and avarice go hand in hand.
Alas! it is the scandal caused by the clergy that plunges so
many poor souls into everlasting perdition. A thorough reform must be effected.”
A more able and forcible denunciation of the papal abuses
could not have been made by Luther himself; and the fact
that the speaker was a determined enemy of the Reformer,
gave greater influence to his words.
Had the eyes of the assembly been opened, they would
have beheld angels of God in the midst of them, shedding
beams of light athwart the darkness of error, and opening
minds and hearts to the reception of truth. It was the power
of the God of truth and wisdom that controlled even the ad-

Luther

before

the

Diet

[149-151]

105

versaries of the Reformation, and thus prepared the way for
the great work about to be accomplished. Martin Luther was
not present; but the voice of One greater than Luther had
been heard in that assembly.
The council now demanded the Reformer’s appearance before them. Notwithstanding the entreaties, protests, and threats of Aleander, the emperor at last consented, and Luther was summoned to appear before the
Diet. With the summons was issued a safe-conduct, insuring his return to a place of security. These were borne to
Wittemberg by a herald, who was commissioned to conduct
him to Worms.
The friends of Luther were terrified and distressed. Knowing the prejudice and enmity against him, they feared that
even his safe-conduct would not be respected, and they entreated him not to imperil his life. He replied: “The papists
have little desire to see me at Worms, but they long for
my condemnation and death. It matters not. Pray not
for me, but for the word of God. . . . Christ will give me
His Spirit to overcome these ministers of Satan. I despise
them while I live; I will triumph over them by my death.
They are busy at Worms about compelling me to recant. My
recantation shall be this: I said formerly that the pope was
Christ’s vicar; now I say that he is the adversary of the Lord,
and the apostle of the devil.”
Luther was not to make his perilous journey alone. Besides the imperial messenger, three of his firmest friends
determined to accompany him. A multitude of students and
citizens, to whom the gospel was precious, bade him farewell with weeping, as he departed. Thus the Reformer and
his companions set out from Wittemberg.
On the journey they saw that the minds of the people were
oppressed by gloomy forebodings. At some towns no honors were proffered them. As they stopped for the night, a
friendly priest expressed his fears by holding up before Luther
the portrait of an Italian reformer who had suffered martyrdom for the truth’s sake. The next day they learned that
Luther’s writings had been condemned at Worms. Im-

106

The

Great

Controversy

perial messengers were proclaiming the emperor’s decree,
and urging all men to bring the proscribed works to the magistrates. The herald, in alarm, asked the Reformer if he still
wished to go forward. He answered, “I will go on, though I
should be put under interdict in every town.”
At Erfurth, Luther was received with honor. Surrounded
by admiring crowds, he entered the city where, in his earlier
years, he had often begged a morsel of bread. He was urged
to preach. This he had been forbidden to do; but the herald
gave his consent, and the monk whose duty it once was to
unclose the gates and sweep the aisles, now ascended the
pulpit, while the people listened to his words as if spellbound. The bread of life was broken to those starving souls.
Christ was lifted up before them as above popes, legates,
emperors, and kings. Luther made no reference to his own
perilous position. He did not seek to make himself the object
of thought or sympathy. In the contemplation of Christ, he
had lost sight of self. He hid behind the Man of Calvary,
seeking only to present Jesus as the sinner’s Redeemer.
As the Reformer proceeded on his journey, he was everywhere regarded with great interest. An eager multitude
thronged about him; and friendly voices warned him of the
purpose of the Romanists. “You will be burned alive,” said
they, “and your body reduced to ashes, as was that of John
Huss.” Luther answered, “Though they should kindle a fire
all the way from Worms to Wittemberg, whose flames should
rise up to heaven, I would go through it in the name of the
Lord, and stand before them; I would enter the jaws of this
behemoth, and break his teeth, confessing the Lord Jesus
Christ.”
The news of his approach to Worms created great
commotion. His friends trembled for his safety; his enemies feared for the success of their cause. Strenuous efforts were made to dissuade him from entering the city. The
papists urged him to repair to the castle of a friendly knight,
where, they declared, all difficulties could be amicably adjusted. The advocates of truth endeavored to excite his fears
by describing the dangers that threatened him. All their ef-

Luther

the

Diet

[151-155]

107

forts failed. Luther, still unshaken, declared, “Though there
should be as many devils at Worms as there are tiles on its
roofs, I would enter.”
Upon his arrival at Worms, the crowd that flocked to the
gates to welcome him was even greater than at the public
entry of the emperor himself. The excitement was intense,
and from the midst of the throng a shrill and plaintive voice
chanted a funeral dirge, as a warning to Luther of the fate
that awaited him. “God will be my defense,” said he, as he
alighted from his carriage.
The emperor immediately convoked his council to consider what course should be pursued toward Luther. One of
the bishops, a rigid papist, declared: “We have long consulted on this matter. Let your majesty get rid of this man at
once. Did not Sigismund bring John Huss to the stake? We
are under no obligation either to give or to observe the safeconduct of a heretic.” “Not so,” said the emperor; “we must
keep our promise.” It was therefore decided that the Reformer
should be heard.
All the city were eager to see this remarkable man, and he
had enjoyed but a few hours’ rest when noblemen, knights,
priests, and citizens gathered about him. Even his enemies
marked his firm, courageous bearing, the kindly and joyous
expression upon his countenance, and the solemn elevation
and deep earnestness that gave to his words an irresistible
power. Some were convinced that a divine influence attended
him; others declared, as had the Pharisees concerning Christ,
“He hath a devil.”
On the following day, Luther was summoned to attend the Diet. An imperial officer was appointed to conduct
him to the hall of audience; yet it was with difficulty that he
reached the place. Every avenue was crowded with spectators, eager to look upon the monk who had dared resist the
authority of the pope.
As he was about to enter the presence of his judges, an
old general, the hero of many battles, said to him kindly,
“Poor monk! poor monk! thou art now going to make a nobler stand than I, or any other captains, have ever made in

108

The

Great

Controversy

our most bloody battles. But if thy cause is just, and thou art
sure of it, go forward in God’s name, and fear nothing! He
will not forsake thee.”
At length Luther stood before the council. The emperor occupied the throne. He was surrounded by the
most illustrious personages in the empire. Never had any
man appeared in the presence of a more imposing assembly
than that before which Martin Luther was to answer for his
faith.
The very fact of that appearance was a signal victory for
the truth. That a man whom the pope had condemned should
be judged by another tribunal, was virtually a denial of the
pontiff’s supreme authority. The Reformer, placed under ban,
and denounced from human fellowship by the pope, had been
assured protection, and was granted a hearing, by the highest dignitaries of the nation. Rome had commanded him to
be silent; but he was about to speak in the presence of thousands from all parts of Christendom.
In the presence of that powerful and titled assembly, the
lowly-born Reformer seemed awed and embarrassed. Several of the princes, observing his emotion, approached him,
and one of them whispered, “Fear not them which kill the
body, but are not able to kill the soul.” Another said, “When
ye shall be brought before governors and kings for My sake,
it shall be given you, by the Spirit of your Father, what ye
shall say.” Thus the words of Christ were brought by the
world’s great men to strengthen His servant in the hour of
trial.
Luther was conducted to a position directly in front
of the emperor’s throne. A deep silence fell upon the
crowded assembly. Then an imperial officer arose, and,
pointing to a collection of Luther’s writings, demanded that
the Reformer answer two questions,—whether he acknowledged them as his, and whether he proposed to retract the
opinions which he had therein advanced. Luther replied that
as to the first question, he acknowledged the books to be his.
“As to the second,” he said, “seeing it is a question which
concerns faith, the salvation of souls, and the word of God,

Luther

the

Diet

[157-158]

which is the greatest and most precious treasure either in
Heaven or earth, it would be rash and perilous for me to
reply without reflection. I might affirm less than the circumstances demand, or more than truth requires; in either case I
should fall under the sentence of Christ: “Whosoever shall
deny Me before men, him will I also deny before the Father
which is in Heaven.” For this reason I entreat your imperial majesty, with all humility, to allow me time, that I
may answer without offending against the word of God.”
In making this request, Luther moved wisely. His course
convinced the assembly that he did not act from passion or
impulse. Such calmness and self-command, unexpected in
one who had shown himself bold and uncompromising, added
to his power, and enabled him afterward to answer with a
prudence, decision, wisdom, and dignity, that surprised and
disappointed his adversaries, and rebuked their insolence and
pride.
The next day he was to appear to render his second
answer. For a time his heart sunk within him as he contemplated the forces that were combined against the
truth. His faith faltered as his enemies seemed to multiply
before him, and the powers of darkness to prevail. Clouds
gathered about him, and seemed to separate him from God.
He longed for the assurance that the Lord of hosts would
be with him. In anguish of spirit he threw himself with
his face upon the earth, and poured out those broken,
heart-rending cries which none but God can fully understand. In his helplessness, his soul fastened upon Christ,
the mighty deliverer. It was not for his own safety, but for
the success of the truth, that he wrestled with God; and he
prevailed. He was strengthened with the assurance that he
would not appear alone before the council. Peace returned to
his soul, and he rejoiced that he was permitted to uphold and
defend the word of God before the rulers of the nation. An
all-wise providence had permitted Luther to realize his peril,
that he might not trust to his own strength and wisdom, and
rush presumptuously into danger. God was preparing His
servant for the great work before him.

110

The

Great

Controversy

As the time for his appearance drew near, Luther approached a table on which lay the Holy Scriptures, placed
his left hand upon the sacred volume, and, raising his right
hand to Heaven, he vowed to adhere constantly to the gospel, and to confess his faith freely, even though he should be
called to seal his testimony with his blood.
When he was again ushered into the presence of the
Diet, his countenance bore no trace of fear or embarrassment. Calm and peaceful, yet grandly brave and noble,
he stood as God’s witness among the great ones of the earth.
The imperial officer now demanded his decision as to whether
he desired to retract his doctrines. Luther made his answer
in a subdued and humble tone, without violence or passion. His demeanor was diffident and respectful; yet he
manifested a confidence and joy that surprised the assembly.
He stated that his published works were not all of the
same character. In some he had treated of faith and good
works, and even his enemies declared them not only harmless but profitable. To retract these would be to condemn
truths which all parties confessed. The second class consisted
of writings exposing the corruptions and abuses of the papacy. To revoke these works would strengthen the tyranny
of Rome, and open a wider door to many and great impieties. In the third class of his books he had attacked individuals who had defended existing evils. Concerning these
he freely confessed that he had been more violent than was
becoming. He did not claim to be free from fault; but even
these books he could not revoke, for such a course would
embolden the enemies of truth, and they would then take
occasion to crush God’s people with still greater cruelty.
“But as I am a mere man, and not God,” he continued, “I
will defend myself as did Christ, who said, ‘If I have spoken
evil, bear witness of the evil.’ By the mercy of God, I implore your imperial majesty, or any one else who can, whoever he may be, to prove to me from the writings of the prophets that I am in error. As soon as I shall be convinced, I will
instantly retract all my errors, and will be the first to cast my

Luther

before

the

Diet

[158-162]

111

books into the fire. What I have just said, will show that I
have considered and weighed the dangers to which I am exposing myself; but far from being dismayed by them, I rejoice exceedingly to see the gospel this day, as of old, a cause
of trouble and dissension. This is the character, the destiny,
of God’s word. Said Christ, ‘I came not to send peace, but a
sword.’ God is wonderful and terrible in His counsels. Let
us have a care lest in our endeavors to arrest discords we be
found to fight against the holy word of God, and bring down
upon our heads a frightful deluge of inextricable dangers,
present disaster, and everlasting desolation. . . . I might cite
examples drawn from the oracles of God. I might speak of
Pharaohs, of kings of Babylon or of Israel, who were never
more contributing to their own ruin than when, by measures
in appearance most prudent, they thought to establish their
authority. God ‘removeth the mountains, and they know not.’ ”
Luther had spoken in German; he was now requested
to repeat the same words in Latin. Though exhausted by
the previous effort, he complied, and again delivered his
speech, with the same clearness and energy as at the first.
God’s providence directed in this matter. The minds of many
of the princes were so blinded by error and superstition that
at the first delivery they did not see the force of Luther’s
reasoning; but the repetition enabled them clearly to perceive the points presented.
Those who stubbornly closed their eyes to the light, and
determined not to be convinced of the truth, were enraged at
the power of Luther’s words. As he ceased speaking, the
spokesman of the Diet said angrily, “You have not answered the question. A clear and express reply is demanded. Will you or will you not retract?”
The Reformer answered: “Since your most serene majesty and the princes require a simple answer, I will give it
thus: Unless I shall be convinced by proofs from Scripture
or by evident reason (for I believe neither in popes nor in
councils, since they have frequently erred and contradicted
themselves), I cannot choose but adhere to the word of God,
which has possession of my conscience. Nor can I possibly

112

The

Great

Controversy

nor will I ever make any recantation, since it is neither safe
nor honest to act contrary to conscience. Here I take my
stand; I cannot do otherwise. God be my help! Amen.”
Thus stood this righteous man, upon the sure foundation of the word of God. The light of Heaven illuminated
his countenance. His greatness and purity of character, his
peace and joy of heart, were manifest to all as he testified
against the power of error, and witnessed to the superiority
of that faith that overcomes the world.
The whole assembly were for a time speechless with
amazement. The emperor himself and many of the princes
were struck with admiration. The partisans of Rome had been
worsted; their cause appeared in a most unfavorable light.
They sought to maintain their power, not by appealing to the
Scriptures, but by a resort to threats, Rome’s unfailing argument. Said the spokesman of the Diet, “If you do not retract,
the emperor and the States of the empire will proceed to consider how to deal with an obstinate heretic.”
Luther’s friends, who had with great joy listened to his
noble defense, trembled at these words; but the doctor himself said calmly, “May God be my helper! for I can retract
nothing.”
Firm as a rock he stood, while the fiercest billows of
worldly power beat harmlessly against him. The simple
energy of his words, his fearless bearing, his calm, speaking
eye, and the unalterable determination expressed in every
word and act, made a deep impression upon the assembly. It
was evident that he could not be induced, either by promises
or threats, to yield to the mandate of Rome.
The papist leaders were chagrined that their power,
which had caused kings and nobles to tremble, should
be thus despised by a humble monk; they longed to make
him feel their wrath by torturing his life away. But Luther,
understanding his danger, had spoken to all with Christian
dignity and calmness. His words had been free from pride,
passion, and misrepresentation. He lost sight of himself, and
of the great men surrounding him, and felt only that he was
in the presence of One infinitely superior to popes, prelates,

Luther

before

the

Diet

[162-163]

113

kings, and emperors. Christ had spoken through Luther’s
testimony with a power and grandeur that for the time inspired both friends and foes with awe and wonder. The Spirit
of God had been present in that council, impressing the hearts
of the chiefs of the empire. Several of the princes openly
acknowledged the justice of Luther’s cause. Many were convinced of the truth; but with some the impressions received
were not lasting. There was another class who did not at the
time express their convictions, but who, having searched the
Scriptures for themselves, at a future time declared with great
boldness for the Reformation.
The elector Frederick had looked forward with anxiety to Luther’s appearance before the Diet, and with deep
emotion he listened to his speech. He rejoiced at the doctor’s
courage, firmness, and self-possession, and was proud of
being his protector. He contrasted the parties in contest, and
saw that the wisdom of popes, kings, and prelates had been
brought to naught by the power of truth. The papacy had
sustained a defeat which would be felt among all nations
and in all ages.
As the legate perceived the effect produced by Luther’s
speech, he feared, as never before, for the security of the
Romish power, and resolved to employ every means at
his command to effect the Reformer’s overthrow. With
all the eloquence and diplomatic skill for which he was so
eminently distinguished, he represented to the youthful emperor the folly and danger of sacrificing, in the cause of an
insignificant monk, the friendship and support of the powerful see of Rome.
His words were not without effect. On the day following
Luther’s answer, Charles Fifth caused a message to be
presented to the Diet, announcing his determination to
carry out the policy of his predecessors to maintain and
protect the Catholic religion. Since Luther had refused to
renounce his errors, the most vigorous measures should be
employed against him and the heresies he taught. Nevertheless, the safe-conduct granted him must be respected, and
before proceedings against him could be instituted, he must

114

The

Great

Controversy

be allowed to reach his home in safety.
“I am firmly resolved to tread in the footsteps of my ancestors,” wrote the monarch. He had decided that he would
not step out of the path of the custom, even to walk in the
ways of truth and righteousness. Because his fathers did, he
would uphold the papacy, with all its cruelty and corruption.
Thus he took his position, refusing to accept any light in
advance of what his fathers had received, or to perform any
duty that they had not performed.
He seemed to feel that a change of religious views would
be inconsistent with the dignity of a king. There are many at
the present day thus clinging to the customs and traditions
of their fathers. When the Lord sends them additional light,
they refuse to accept it, because, not having been granted to
their fathers, it was not received by them. We are not placed
where our fathers were; consequently our duties and responsibilities are not the same as theirs. We shall not be approved of God in looking to the example of our fathers
to determine our duty instead of searching the word of
truth for ourselves. Our responsibility is greater than was
that of our ancestors. We are accountable for the light which
they received, and which was handed down as an inheritance
for us, and we are accountable also for the additional light
which is now shining upon us from the word of God.
Said Christ of the unbelieving Jews, “If I had not come
and spoken unto them, they had not had sin; but now they
have no cloak for their sin.” John 15:22. The same divine
power had spoken through Luther to the emperor and princes
of Germany. And as the light shone forth from God’s word,
His Spirit pleaded for the last time with many in that assembly. As Pilate, centuries before, permitted pride and popularity to close his heart against the world’s Redeemer; as the
trembling Felix bade the messenger of truth, “Go thy way
for this time; when I have a convenient season I will call for
thee;” as the proud Agrippa confessed, “Almost thou
persuadest me to be a Christian,” yet turned away from the
Heaven-sent message,—so had Charles Fifth, yielding to the
dictates of worldly pride and policy, decided to reject the

Luther

before

the

Diet

[163-165]

115

light of truth.
Several of the pope’s adherents demanded that Luther’s safe-conduct should not be respected. “The Rhine,”
they said, “should receive his ashes, as it received those of
John Huss a century ago.” Rumors of the designs against
Luther were widely circulated, causing great excitement
throughout the city. The Reformer had made many friends,
who, knowing the treacherous cruelty of Rome toward all
that dared expose her corruptions, resolved that he should
not be sacrificed. Hundreds of nobles pledged themselves to
protect him. Not a few openly denounced the royal message
as evincing a weak submission to the controlling power of
Rome. On the gates of houses and in public places, placards
were posted, some condemning and others sustaining Luther.
On one of them were written merely the significant words of
the wise man, “Woe to thee, O land, when thy king is a child.”
The popular enthusiasm in Luther’s favor throughout all Germany convinced both the emperor and the Diet that any injustice shown him would endanger the peace of the empire,
and even the stability of the throne.
Frederick of Saxony maintained a studied reserve,
carefully concealing his real feelings toward the Reformer, while at the same time he guarded him with tireless vigilance, watching all his movements and all those of
his enemies. But there were many who made no attempt to
conceal their sympathy. Princes, knights, gentlemen, ecclesiastics, and common people surrounded Luther’s lodgings,
entering and gazing upon him as though he were more than
human. Even those who believed him to be in error could not
but admire that nobility of soul which led him to imperil his
life rather than violate his conscience.
Earnest efforts were made to obtain Luther’s consent
to a compromise with Rome. Nobles and princes represented to him that if he persisted in setting up his own judgment against that of the church and the councils, he would
soon be banished from the empire, and then would have no
defense. To this appeal Luther answered: “It is impossible
to preach the gospel of Christ without offense. Why, then,

116

The

Great

Controversy

should the fear of danger separate me from the Lord and that
divine word which alone is truth? No; I would rather give up
my body, my blood, and my life.”
Again he was urged to submit to the judgment of the emperor, and then he would have nothing to fear. “I consent,”
said he in reply, “with all my heart, that the emperor, the
princes, and even the humblest Christian, should examine
and judge my writings; but on one condition, that they take
God’s word for their guide. Men have nothing to do but render obedience to that. My conscience is in dependence upon
that word, and I am the subject of its authority.”
To another appeal he said, “I consent to forego my safeconduct, and resign my person and my life to the emperor’s
disposal; but as to the word of God—never!” He stated his
willingness to submit to the decision of a general council,
but only on condition that the council be required to decide
according to the Scriptures. Both friends and foes were at
last convinced that further effort for reconciliation would be
useless.
Had the Reformer yielded a single point, Satan and his
hosts would have gained the victory. But his unwavering
firmness was the means of emancipating the church, and
beginning a new and better era. The influence of this one
man, who dared to think and act for himself in religious
matters, was to affect the church and the world, not only
in his own time, but in all future generations. His firmness
and fidelity would strengthen all, to the close of time, who
should pass through a similar experience. The power and
majesty of God stood forth above the counsel of men, above
the mighty power of Satan.
Luther was soon commanded by the authority of the
emperor to return home, and he knew that this notice
would be speedily followed by his condemnation. Threatening clouds overhung his path; but as he departed from
Worms, his heart was filled with joy and praise. “Satan himself,” said he, “kept the pope’s citadel; but Christ has made
a wide breach in it, and the devil has been compelled to confess that Christ is mightier than he.” On this journey the

Luther

before

the

Diet

[165-168]

117

Reformer received the most flattering attentions from all
classes. Dignitaries of the church welcomed the monk upon
whom the pope’s curse rested, and secular officers honored
the man who was under the ban of the empire.
He had not been long absent from Worms, when the
papists prevailed upon the emperor to issue an edict
against him. In this decree Luther was denounced as “Satan
himself under the semblance of a man in a monk’s hood.” It
was commanded that as soon as his safe-conduct should expire, measures be taken to stop his work. All persons were
forbidden to harbor him, to give him food or drink, or by
word or act, in public or private, to aid or abet him. He was
to be seized wherever he might be, and delivered to the authorities. His adherents also were to be imprisoned, and their
property confiscated. His writings were to be destroyed, and
finally, all who should dare to act contrary to this decree were
included in its condemnation. The emperor had spoken, and
the Diet had given its sanction to the decree. The Romanists
were jubilant. Now they considered the fate of the Reformation sealed.
God had provided a way of escape for His servant in this
hour of peril. A vigilant eye had followed Luther’s movements, and a true and noble heart had resolved upon his rescue. It was plain that Rome would be satisfied with nothing
short of his death; only by concealment could he be preserved
from the jaws of the lion. God gave wisdom to Frederick
of Saxony to devise a plan for the Reformer’s preservation. With the co-operation of true friends, the elector’s
purpose was carried out, and Luther was effectually hidden from friends and foes. Upon his homeward journey, he
was seized, separated from his attendants, and hurriedly
conveyed through the forests to the castle of Wartburg,
an isolated mountain fortress. Both his seizure and his
concealment were so involved in mystery that even Frederick
himself for a long time knew not whither he had been conducted. This ignorance was not without design: so long as
the elector knew nothing of Luther’s whereabouts, he could
reveal nothing. He satisfied himself that the Reformer was

118

The

Great

Controversy

safe, and with this knowledge he was content.
Spring, summer, and autumn passed, and winter came,
and Luther still remained a prisoner. Aleander and his partisans rejoiced that the light of the gospel seemed about to be
extinguished. But instead of this, the Reformer was filling
his lamp from the store-house of truth, to shine forth in due
time with brighter radiance.
In the friendly security of the Wartburg, Luther for a time
rejoiced in his release from the heat and turmoil of battle.
But he could not long find satisfaction in quiet and repose.
Accustomed to a life of activity and stern conflict, he could
ill endure to remain inactive. In those solitary days, the condition of the church rose up before him, and he cried in despair, “Alas! there is no one in this latter day of His anger to
stand like a wall before the Lord, and save Israel!” Again,
his thoughts returned to himself, and he feared being charged
with cowardice in withdrawing from the contest. Then he
reproached himself for his indolence and self-indulgence. Yet
at the same time he was daily accomplishing more than it
seemed possible for one man to do. His pen was never
idle. While his enemies flattered themselves that he was
silenced, they were astonished and confused by tangible
proof that he was still active. A host of tracts, issuing
from his pen, circulated throughout Germany. He also
performed a most important service for his countrymen
by translating the New Testament into the German
tongue. From his rocky Patmos he continued for nearly a
whole year to proclaim the gospel, and rebuke the sins and
errors of the times.
But it was not merely to preserve Luther from the wrath
of his enemies, nor even to afford him a season of quiet for
these important labors, that God had withdrawn His servant
from the stage of public life. There were results more precious than these to be secured. In the solitude and obscurity
of his mountain retreat, Luther was removed from earthly
supports, and shut out from human praise. He was thus saved
from the pride and self-confidence that are so often caused
by success. By suffering and humiliation he was prepared

Luther

before

the

Diet

[168-169]

119

again to walk safely upon the dizzy heights to which he had
been so suddenly exalted.
As men rejoice in the freedom which the truth brings them,
they are inclined to extol those whom God has employed to
break the chains of error and superstition. Satan seeks to
divert men’s thoughts and affections from God, and fix them
upon human agencies; to honor the mere instrument, and to
ignore the Hand that directs all the events of providence.
Too often, religious leaders who are thus praised and reverenced lose sight of their dependence upon God, and are led
to trust in themselves. As a result, they seek to control the
minds and consciences of the people, who are disposed to
look to them for guidance instead of looking to the word of
God. The work of reform is often retarded because of this
spirit indulged by its supporters. From this danger, God would
guard the cause of the Reformation. He desired that work
to receive, not the impress of man, but of God. The eyes
of men had been turned to Luther as the expounder of the
truth; he was removed that all eyes might be directed to the
eternal Author of truth.

Luther’s mysterious disappearance excited consternation throughout all Germany. Inquiries concerning him
were heard everywhere. Even his enemies were more agitated by his absence than they could have been by his presence. The wildest rumors were circulated, and many believed
that he had been murdered. There was great lamentation, not
only by his avowed friends, but by thousands who had not
openly taken their stand with the Reformation. Many bound
themselves by a solemn oath to avenge his death.
The Romanists saw with terror to what a pitch had
risen the feeling against them. Though at first exultant at
the supposed death of Luther, they now desired to hide from
the wrath of the people. Those who were enraged against
him when he was at large, were filled with fear now that he
was in captivity. “The only way of extricating ourselves,”
said one, “is to light our torches, and go searching through
the earth for Luther, till we can restore him to a nation that
will have him.” The edict of the emperor seemed to fall powerless. The papal legates were filled with indignation as they
saw that it commanded far less attention than did the fate of
Luther.

122

The

Great

Controversy

The tidings that he was safe, though a prisoner, calmed
the fears of the people, while it still further aroused their
enthusiasm in his favor. His writings were read with greater
eagerness than ever before. Increasing numbers joined the
cause of the heroic man who had, at such fearful odds, defended the word of God. The Reformation was constantly
gaining in strength. The seed which Luther had sown sprung
up everywhere. His absence accomplished a work which his
presence would have failed to do. Other laborers felt a new
responsibility, now that their great leader was removed. With
new faith and earnestness they pressed forward to do all in
their power, that the work so nobly begun might not be hindered.
But Satan was not idle. He now attempted what he has
attempted in every other reformatory movement,—to deceive and destroy the people by palming off upon them a
counterfeit in place of the true work. As there were false
christs in the first century of the Christian church, so there
arose false prophets in the sixteenth century.
A few men, deeply affected by the excitement in the
religious world, imagined themselves to have received
special revelations from Heaven, and claimed to have been
divinely commissioned to carry forward to its completion
the Reformation but feebly begun by Luther. In truth, they
were undoing the very work which he had accomplished.
They rejected the fundamental principle of the Reformation,—the word of God as the all-sufficient rule of faith
and practice; and for that unerring guide they substituted
the changeable, uncertain standard of their own feelings and
impressions. By this act of setting aside the great detector of

ter span 18 months from April 1521 to September 1522. Following his
famous “Here I stand” speech at Worms in April 18, 1521, Luther was
taken to the Wartburg Castle, but left in March 1522 because of the rise of
fanatics. The fanatics came to Wittenburg in December 1521. Fanaticism
resulted in the Peasants’ Revolt (1524-1525). Luther’s German New Testament was published in September 1522.

error and falsehood, the way was opened for Satan to control minds as best pleased himself.
One of these prophets claimed to have been instructed by
the angel Gabriel. A student who united with him abandoned
his studies, declaring that he had received from God Himself the ability to explain the Scriptures. Others who were
naturally inclined to fanaticism united with them. The proceedings of these enthusiasts created no little excitement.
The preaching of Luther had aroused the people everywhere
to feel the necessity of reform, and now some really honest
persons were misled by the pretensions of the new prophets.
The leaders of the movement repaired to Wittemberg,
and urged their claims upon Melancthon and his co-laborers. Said they: “We are sent by God to teach the people.
We have received special revelations from God Himself, and
therefore know what is coming to pass. We are apostles and
prophets, and appeal to Doctor Luther as to the truth of what
we say.”
The Reformers were astonished and perplexed. This
was such an element as they had never before encountered, and they knew not what course to pursue. Said
Melancthon: “There are indeed spirits of no ordinary kind in
these men; but what spirits?” “On the one hand, let us beware of quenching the Spirit of God, and on the other, of
being seduced by the spirit of Satan.”
The fruit of the new teaching soon became apparent.
The minds of the people were diverted from the word of God,
or decidedly prejudiced against it. The schools were thrown
into confusion. Students, spurning all restraint, abandoned
their studies. The men who thought themselves competent
to revive and control the work of the Reformation, succeeded
only in bringing it to the very brink of ruin. The Romanists
now regained their confidence, and exclaimed exultingly,
“One more effort, and all will be ours.”
Luther at the Wartburg, hearing of what had occurred,
said with deep concern, “I always expected that Satan would
send us this plague.” He perceived the true character of those
pretended prophets, and saw the danger that threatened the

124

The

Controversy

cause of truth. The opposition of the pope and the emperor
had not caused him so great perplexity and distress as he
now experienced. From the professed friends of the Reformation had risen its worst enemies. The very truths
which had brought peace to his troubled heart had been made
the cause of dissension in the church.
In the work of reform, Luther had been urged forward by
the Spirit of God, and had been carried beyond himself. He
had not purposed to take such positions as he did, or to make
so radical changes. He had been but the instrument in the
hands of infinite power. Yet he often trembled for the result
of his work. He had once said, “If I knew that my doctrine
had injured one human being, however poor and unknown,—
which it could not, for it is the very gospel,—I would rather
face death ten times over than retract it.”
And now a whole city, and that city Wittemberg itself,
was fast sinking into confusion. The doctrines taught by
Luther had not caused this evil; but throughout Germany his
enemies were charging it upon him. In bitterness of soul he
sometimes asked, “Can such be the end of this great work of
the Reformation?” Again, as he wrestled with God in prayer,
peace flowed into his heart. “The work is not mine, but Thine
own,” he said; “Thou wilt not suffer it to be corrupted by
superstition or fanaticism.” But the thought of remaining
longer from the conflict in such a crisis, became insupportable. He determined to return to Wittemberg.
Without delay he set out on his perilous journey. He
was under the ban of the empire. Enemies were at liberty to take his life; friends were forbidden to aid or shelter
him. The imperial government was adopting the most stringent measures against his adherents. But he saw that the work
of the gospel was imperiled, and in the name of the Lord he
went forth once more to battle for the truth.
With great caution and humility, yet with decision and
firmness, he entered upon his work. “By the word,” said
he, “we must refute and expel what has gained a place and
influence by violence. I would not resort to force against the
superstitious and unbelieving.” “Let there be no compulsion.

I have been laboring for liberty of conscience. Liberty is the
very essence of faith.” Ascending the pulpit, he with great
wisdom and gentleness instructed, exhorted, and reproved,
and by the power of the gospel brought back the misguided
people into the way of truth.
Luther had no desire to encounter the fanatics whose
course had been productive of so great evil. He knew them
to be men of hasty and violent temper, who, while claiming
to be especially illuminated from Heaven, would not endure
the slightest contradiction, or even the kindest admonition.
Arrogating to themselves supreme authority, they required
every one, without a question, to acknowledge their claims.
But as they demanded an interview with him, he consented to meet them; and so successfully did he expose
their pretensions, that the impostors at once departed
from Wittemberg.
The fanaticism was checked for a time; but several
years later it broke out with greater violence and more
terrible results. Said Luther, concerning the leaders in this
movement: “To them the Holy Scriptures were but a dead
letter, and they all began to cry, ‘The Spirit! the Spirit!’ But
most assuredly I will not follow where their spirit leads them.
May God in His mercy preserve me from a church in which
there are none but saints. I wish to be in fellowship with the
humble, the feeble, the sick, who know and feel their sins,
and who sigh and cry continually to God from the bottom of
their hearts to obtain His consolation and support.”
Thomas Munzer, the most active of the fanatics, was a
man of considerable ability, which, rightly directed, would
have enabled him to do good; but he had not learned the first
principles of true religion. He imagined himself ordained of
God to reform the world, forgetting, like many other enthusiasts, that the reform should begin with himself. He was
ambitious to obtain position and influence, and unwilling to
be second, even to Luther. He charged the Reformers with
establishing, by their adherence to the Bible alone, a species
of popery. He considered himself called of God to remedy
the evil, and held that manifestations of the Spirit were the

126

The

Great

Controversy

means by which this was to be accomplished, and that he
who had the Spirit possessed the true faith, though he might
never see the written word.
The fanatical teachers gave themselves up to be governed by impressions, calling every thought of the mind
the voice of God; consequently they went to great extremes. Some even burned their Bibles, exclaiming, “The
letter killeth, but the Spirit giveth life.” Men naturally love
the marvelous, and whatever flatters their pride, and many
were ready to accept Munzer’s teachings. He soon denounced
all order in public worship, and declared that to obey princes
was to attempt to serve both God and Belial.
The minds of the people, already beginning to throw
off the yoke of the papacy, were also becoming impatient under the restraints of civil authority. Munzer’s
revolutionary teachings, claiming divine sanction, led
them to break away from all control, and give the rein to
their prejudices and passions. The most terrible scenes of
sedition and strife followed, and the fields of Germany were
drenched with blood.
The agony of soul which Luther had so long before experienced in his cell at Erfurth, now pressed upon him with
redoubled power as he saw the results of fanaticism charged
upon the Reformation. The papist princes declared, and many
believed, that Luther’s doctrine had been the cause of the
rebellion. Although this charge was without the slightest
foundation, it could not but cause the Reformer great distress. That the work of Heaven should be thus degraded by
being classed with the basest fanaticism, seemed more than
he could endure. On the other hand, the leaders in the revolt
hated Luther because he had not only opposed their doctrines and denied their claims to divine inspiration, but had
pronounced them rebels against the civil authority. In retaliation they denounced him as a base pretender. He seemed to
have brought upon himself the enmity of both princes and
people.
The Romanists exulted, expecting to witness the

speedy downfall of the Reformation; and they blamed
Luther, even for the errors which he had been most earnestly
endeavoring to correct. The fanatical party, by falsely claiming to have been treated with great injustice, succeeded in
gaining the sympathies of a large class of the people, and, as
is usually the case with those who take the wrong side, they
came to be regarded as martyrs. Thus the ones who were
exerting every energy in opposition to the Reformation were
pitied and lauded as the victims of cruelty and oppression.
This was the work of Satan, prompted by the same spirit of
rebellion which was first manifested in Heaven.
Satan is constantly seeking to deceive men, and lead
them to call sin righteousness, and righteousness sin. How
successful has been his work! How often are censure and
reproach cast upon God’s faithful servants because they will
stand fearlessly in defense of the truth! Men who are but
agents of Satan are praised and flattered, and even looked
upon as martyrs, while those who should be respected and
sustained for their fidelity to God, are left to stand alone,
under suspicion and distrust.
Counterfeit holiness, spurious sanctification, is still doing its work of deception. Under various forms it exhibits
the same spirit as in the days of Luther, diverting minds from
the Scriptures, and leading men to follow their own feelings
and impressions rather than to yield obedience to the law of
God. This is one of Satan’s most successful devices to cast
reproach upon purity and truth.
Fearlessly did Luther defend the gospel from the attacks which came from every quarter. The word of God
proved itself a weapon mighty in every conflict. With that
word he warred against the usurped authority of the pope,
and the rationalistic philosophy of the schoolmen, while he
stood firm as a rock against the fanaticism that sought to
ally itself with the Reformation.
Each of these opposing elements was in its own way setting aside the Holy Scriptures, and exalting human wisdom
as the source of religious truth and knowledge. Rationalism

128

The

Great

Controversy

idolizes reason, and makes this the criterion for religion.
Romanism, claiming for her sovereign pontiff an inspiration
descended in unbroken line from the apostles, and unchangeable through all time, gives ample opportunity for every species of extravagance and corruption to be concealed under
the sanctity of the apostolic commission. The inspiration
claimed by Munzer and his associates proceeded from no
higher source than the vagaries of the imagination, and its
influence was subversive of all authority, human or divine.
True Christianity receives the word of God as the great treasure-house of inspired truth, and the test of all inspiration.
Upon his return from the Wartburg, Luther completed
his translation of the New Testament, and the gospel was
soon after given to the people of Germany in their own
language. This translation was received with great joy by
all who loved the truth; but it was scornfully rejected by those
who chose human traditions and the commandments of men.
The priests were alarmed at the thought that the common people would now be able to discuss with them the
precepts of God’s word, and that their own ignorance
would thus be exposed. The weapons of their carnal reasoning were powerless against the sword of the Spirit. Rome
summoned all her authority to prevent the circulation of the
Scriptures; but decrees, anathemas, and tortures were alike
in vain. The more she condemned and prohibited the Bible,
the greater was the anxiety of the people to know what it
really taught. All who could read were eager to study the
word of God for themselves. They carried it about with them,
and read and re-read, and could not be satisfied until they
had committed large portions to memory. Seeing the favor
with which the New Testament was received, Luther immediately began the translation of the Old, and published it in
parts as fast as completed.
Luther’s writings were welcomed alike in city and in
hamlet. At night the teachers of the village schools read them
aloud to little groups gathered at the fireside. With every
effort, some souls would be convicted of the truth, and, re-

ceiving the word with gladness, would in their turn tell the
good news to others.
The words of inspiration were verified: “The entrance of
Thy words giveth light; it giveth understanding unto the
simple.” Psalm 119:130. The study of the Scriptures was
working a mighty change in the minds and hearts of the
people. The papal rule had placed upon its subjects an iron
yoke which held them in ignorance and degradation. A superstitious observance of forms had been scrupulously maintained; but in all their service the heart and intellect had had
little part. The preaching of Luther, setting forth the plain
truths of God’s word, and then the word itself, placed in the
hands of the common people, had aroused their dormant powers, not only purifying and ennobling the spiritual nature,
but imparting new strength and vigor to the intellect.
Persons of all ranks were to be seen with the Bible in
their hands, defending the doctrines of the Reformation.
The papists who had left the study of the Scriptures to the
priests and monks, now called upon them to come forward
and refute the new teachings. But, ignorant alike of the Scriptures and of the power of God, priests and friars were totally
defeated by those whom they had denounced as unlearned
and heretical. “Unhappily,” said a Catholic writer,
“Luther had persuaded his followers that their faith
ought only to be founded on the oracles of Holy Writ.”
Crowds would gather to hear the truth advocated by men of
little education, and even discussed by them with learned
and eloquent theologians. The shameful ignorance of these
great men was made apparent as their arguments were
met by the simple teachings of God’s word. Women and
children, artisans and soldiers, had a better knowledge of the
Scriptures than had learned doctors or surpliced priests.
As the Romish clergy saw their congregations diminishing, they invoked the aid of the magistrates, and by every
means in their power endeavored to bring back their hearers.
But the people had found in the new teachings that which
supplied the wants of their souls, and they turned away

130

The

Great

Controversy

from those who had so long fed them with the worthless
husks of superstitious rites and human traditions.
When persecution was kindled against the teachers of the
truth, they gave heed to the words of Christ, “When they
persecute you in this city, flee ye into another.” Matthew
10:23. The light penetrated everywhere. The fugitives would
find somewhere a hospitable door opened to them, and there
abiding, they would preach Christ, sometimes in the church,
or, if denied that privilege, in private houses or in the open
air. Wherever they could obtain a hearing was a consecrated
temple. The truth, proclaimed with such energy and assurance, spread with irresistible power.
In vain were both ecclesiastical and civil authorities
invoked to crush the heresy. In vain they resorted to imprisonment, torture, fire, and sword. Thousands of believers sealed their faith with their blood, and yet the
work went on. Persecution served only to extend the truth;
and the fanaticism which Satan endeavored to unite with it,
resulted in making more clear the contrast between the work
of Satan and the work of God.

———————————————————————

One of the noblest testimonies ever uttered for the Reformation was the Protest offered by the Christian princes
of Germany at the Diet of Spires. The courage, faith, and
firmness of these men of God, gained for succeeding ages
liberty of thought and of conscience. Their Protest gave to
the reformed church the name of Protestant; its principles
are the very essence of Protestantism.
A dark and threatening day had come for the Reformation. For a season religious toleration had prevailed in
the empire; God’s providence had held opposing elements in check, that the gospel might obtain a firmer
foothold; but Rome had now summoned her forces to
crush out the truth. At Spires the papists openly manifested
their hostility toward the Reformers and all who favored them.
Said Melancthon, “We are the execration and the sweepings

Protest

of

the

Princes

[197-198]

133

of the earth; but Christ will look down on His poor people,
and will preserve them.” The evangelical princes in attendance at the Diet were forbidden even to have the gospel
preached in their dwellings. But the people of Spires thirsted
for the word of God, and, notwithstanding the prohibition,
thousands flocked to the morning and evening worship still
held in the chapel of the Elector of Saxony.
This hastened the crisis. An imperial message announced to the Diet that as the resolution granting liberty of conscience had given rise to great disorders, the
emperor declared it to be annulled. This arbitrary act
excited the indignation and alarm of the evangelical
Christians. Said one, “Christ has again fallen into the hands
of Caiaphas and Pilate.” The Romanists became more violent. A bigoted papist declared, “The Turks are better than
the Lutherans; for the Turks observe fast-days, and the
Lutherans violate them. If we must choose between the Holy
Scriptures of God and the old errors of the church, we should
reject the former.” Said Melancthon, “Every day, in full assembly, Faber casts some new stone against the Gospellers.”
Religious toleration had been legally established, and
the evangelical States were resolved to oppose the infringement of their rights. Luther, being still under the ban
imposed by the edict of Worms, was not permitted to be
present at Spires; but his place was supplied by his co-laborers and the princes whom God had raised up to defend
his cause in this emergency. The noble Frederick of Saxony,
Luther’s former protector, had been removed by death; but

17 months, from February 1529 to June 1530. Luther was about 47 years
old by this time. On the death of Frederick in 1525, his brother John of
Saxony became Luther’s protector. The first Diet [Council] of Spires (today called Speyer) met in summer 1526, but dared not oppose the Protestants because of the Turkish menace in the East. The Second Diet of
Spires convened in February 1529. The majority of German princes were
Catholic, and issued an ultimatum to the Protestant princes. The famous
“Protest” (Protestatio) of those princes was presented to the Second Diet
on April 19, 1529. In summer 1530, the Diet of Augsburg met, and the
Protestant “Confession” was presented to the Diet on June 25.

134

The

Great

Controversy

Duke John his brother, who succeeded to the throne, had
joyfully welcomed the Reformation, and while a friend of
peace, he displayed great energy and courage in all matters
relating to the interests of the faith.
The priests demanded that the States which had accepted the Reformation submit implicitly to Romish jurisdiction. The Reformers, on the other hand, claimed
the liberty which had previously been granted. They could
not consent that Rome should again bring under her control
those nations that had with so great joy received the word of
God. The Diet finally decreed, that where the Reformation
had not become established, the edict of Worms should be
rigorously enforced; and that in the evangelical States, where
there would be danger of revolt, no new reform should be
introduced, there should be no preaching upon disputed
points, the celebration of the mass should not be opposed,
and no Roman Catholic should be permitted to embrace
Lutheranism.
If this decree became a law, the Reformation could
neither be extended where as yet it had not reached, nor
be established on a firm foundation where it already existed. Liberty of speech would be prohibited. No conversions would be allowed. And to these restrictions and prohibitions the friends of the Reformation were required at once
to submit. The hopes of the world seemed about to be extinguished. The re-establishment of the papal hierarchy would
inevitably cause a revival of the ancient abuses; and an occasion would readily be found for completing the destruction of a work that had already been shaken by fanaticism
and dissension.
As the evangelical party met for consultation, one looked
to another in blank dismay. From one to another passed the
inquiry, “What is to be done?” Mighty issues for the world
were at stake. Had these men been controlled by ambition or selfishness, they might have accepted the decree.
They themselves were apparently left free to maintain
their faith. Ought they not to be satisfied with this? Should
they throw themselves into the conflict to wrestle for liberty

Protest

of

the

Princes

[199-201]

135

of conscience in all the world? Should they expose themselves to the vengeance of Rome?
Never were these men placed in a more trying position;
but they came forth from the test with principles unsullied.
As the mist that had hovered over their minds cleared away,
they saw what would be the result of this decree. Should
they lend their influence to restore the stake and the torture? Should they oppose the advancement of truth,—
oppose the Spirit of God in its work of calling men to
Christ? Could they refuse obedience to the Saviour’s command, “Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to
every creature”? Mark 16:15. Ought they to consent that
those who might desire to renounce error should be denied
the privilege? Having entered the kingdom of Heaven
themselves, should they bar the way so that others could
not enter? Rather would they sacrifice their dominions, their
titles, and their own lives.
“Let us reject this decree,” said the princes. “In matters of conscience the majority has no power.” The deputies declared that Germany was indebted to the decree of
toleration for the peace which she enjoyed, and that its abolition would fill the empire with troubles and divisions. “The
Diet is incompetent,” said they, “to do more than preserve
religious liberty until a council meets.” To protect liberty of
conscience is the duty of the State, and this is the limit of its
authority in matters of religion. Every secular government
that attempts to regulate or enforce religious observances by
civil authority is sacrificing the very principle for which the
evangelical Christians so nobly struggled.
The papists determined to put down what they termed daring obstinacy. They began by endeavoring to cause divisions
among the supporters of the Reformation, and to intimidate
all who had not openly declared in its favor. The princes
were at last summoned before the Diet. They pleaded for
delay, but in vain. Those who still refused to sacrifice liberty
of conscience and the right of individual judgment well knew
that their position marked them for future criticism, condemnation, and persecution. Said one of the Reformers, “We

136

The

Great

Controversy

must either deny the word of God or—be burned.”
King Ferdinand, the emperor’s representative at the Diet,
saw that the decree would cause serious divisions unless the
princes could be induced to accept and sustain it. He therefore tried the art of persuasion, well knowing that to employ
force with such men would only render them more determined. He begged them to accept the decree, assuring them
that such an act would be highly gratifying to the emperor.
But these faithful men acknowledged an authority above that
of earthly rulers, and they answered calmly, “We will obey
the emperor in everything that may contribute to maintain
peace and the honor of God.”
In the presence of the Diet, the king at last announced
to the elector and his friends that their only remaining
course was to submit to the majority. Having thus spoken, he withdrew from the assembly, giving the Reformers
no opportunity for deliberation or reply. In vain they sent
messengers entreating him to return. To their remonstrances
he answered only, “It is a settled affair; submission in all
that remains.”
The imperial party were convinced that the Christian
princes would adhere to the Holy Scriptures as superior to
human doctrines and requirements; and they knew that an
acceptance of this principle would eventually overthrow the
papacy. But they flattered themselves that weakness was on
the side of the Reformation, while strength was with the
emperor and the pope. Had the Reformers made flesh their
arm, they would have been as powerless as the papists supposed. But though weak in numbers, and at variance with
Rome, they had their strength. They appealed from the
decision of the Diet to the word of God, and from the
emperor of Germany to the King of kings and Lord of
lords.
As Ferdinand had refused to regard their conscientious
convictions, the princes decided not to heed his absence, but
to bring their Protest before the national council without delay. A solemn declaration was therefore drawn up, and
presented to the Diet:

Protest of the Princes

[201-204]

137

“We protest by these presents, before God, our only Creator, Preserver, Redeemer, and Saviour, and who will one
day be our Judge, as well as before all men and all creatures,
that we, for us and our people, neither consent nor adhere in
any manner whatever to the proposed decree in anything that
is contrary to God, to His word, to our right conscience, or
to the salvation of our souls. . . . We cannot assert that when
Almighty God calls a man to his knowledge, he dare not
embrace that divine knowledge. . . . There is no true doctrine
but that which conforms to the word of God. The Lord forbids the teaching of any other faith. The Holy Scriptures,
with one text explained by other and plainer texts, are, in all
things necessary for the Christian, easy to be understood,
and adapted to enlighten. We are therefore resolved by divine grace to maintain the pure preaching of God’s only word,
as it is contained in the scriptures of the Old and New Testaments, without anything added thereto. This word is the only
truth. It is the sure rule of all doctrine and life, and can never
fail or deceive us. He who builds on this foundation shall
stand against all the powers of hell, whilst all the vanities
that are set up against it shall fall before the face of God.”
“We therefore reject the yoke that is imposed upon us.”
A deep impression was made upon the Diet. The majority were filled with amazement and alarm at the boldness of the protesters. The future appeared to them stormy
and uncertain. Dissension, strife, and bloodshed seemed inevitable. But the Reformers, assured of the justice of their
cause, and relying upon the arm of Omnipotence, were full
of courage and firmness.
The Protest denied the right of civil rulers to legislate
in matters between the soul and God, and declared with
prophets and apostles, “We ought to obey God rather than
men.” It rejected also the arbitrary power of the church, and
set forth the unerring principle that all human teaching should
be in subjection to the oracles of God. The protesters had
thrown off the yoke of man’s supremacy, and had exalted
Christ as supreme in the church, and His word in the pulpit.
The power of conscience was set above the State, and the

138

The

Great

Controversy

authority of the Holy Scriptures above the visible church.
The crown of Christ was uplifted above the pope’s tiara and
the emperor’s diadem. The protesters had moreover affirmed
their right to freely utter their convictions of truth. They would
not only believe and obey, but teach what the word of God
presents, and they denied the right of priest or magistrate to
interfere. The Protest of Spires was a solemn witness
against religious intolerance, and an assertion of the right
of all men to worship according to the dictates of their
own consciences.
The declaration had been made. It was written in the
memory of thousands, and registered in the books of Heaven,
where no effort of man could erase it. All evangelical Germany adopted the Protest as the expression of its faith.
Everywhere men beheld in this declaration the promise of a
new and better era. Said one of the princes to the Protestants
of Spires, “May the Almighty, who has given you grace to
confess energetically, freely, and fearlessly, preserve you in
that Christian firmness until the day of eternity.”
Had the Reformation, after attaining a degree of success, consented to temporize to secure favor with the
world, it would have been untrue to God and to itself,
and would thus have insured its own destruction. The
experience of those early reformers contains a lesson for all
succeeding ages. Satan’s manner of working against God
and His word has not changed; he is still as much opposed to the Scriptures being made the guide of life as in
the sixteenth century. In our time there is a wide departure
from its doctrines and precepts, and there is need of a return
to the great Protestant principle,—the Bible and the Bible
only as the rule of faith and duty. Satan is still working
through every means which he can control to destroy
religious liberty. The anti-christian power which the protesters of Spires repudiated, is now with renewed vigor seeking to reestablish its lost supremacy. The same unswerving
adherence to the word of God manifested at that crisis of the
Reformation, is the only hope of reform to-day.
There appeared tokens of danger to the Protestants.

Protest of the Princes

[206-207]

139

There were tokens, also, that the divine hand was stretched
out to protect the faithful. It was about this time that
Melancthon hurried his friend Grynaeus through the streets
of Spires to the Rhine, and urged him to cross the river without delay. Grynaeus, in astonishment, desired to know the
reason for this sudden flight. Said Melancthon, “An old man
of grave and solemn aspect, but who is unknown to me, appeared before me, and said, ‘In a minute the officers of justice will be sent by Ferdinand to arrest Grynaeus.’ ” On the
banks of the Rhine, Melancthon waited until the waters of
that stream interposed between his beloved friend and those
who sought his life. When he saw him on the other side at
last, he said, “He is torn from the cruel jaws of those who
thirst for innocent blood.”
Grynaeus had been on intimate terms with a leading papist doctor; but, having been shocked at one of his sermons,
he went to him, and entreated that he would no longer war
against the truth. The papist concealed his anger, but immediately repaired to the king, and obtained from him authority
to arrest the protester. When Melancthon returned to his
house, he was informed that after his departure officers in
pursuit of Grynaeus had searched it from top to bottom. He
ever believed that the Lord had saved his friend by sending a
holy angel to give him warning.
The Reformation was to be brought into greater prominence before the mighty ones of the earth. The evangelical
princes had been denied a hearing by King Ferdinand; but
they were to be granted an opportunity to present their cause
in the presence of the emperor and the assembled dignitaries
of Church and State. To quiet the dissensions which disturbed the empire, Charles Fifth convoked a Diet at
Augsburg, over which he announced his intention to preside in person. Thither the Protestant leaders were summoned.
Great dangers threatened the Reformation; but its advocates still trusted their cause with God, and pledged themselves to be firm to the gospel. They determined to prepare a statement of their views in systematic form, with

140

The

Great

Controversy

the evidence from the Scriptures, to present before the
Diet; and the task was committed to Luther, Melancthon,
and their associates. The Confession thus prepared was
accepted by the Protestants as an exposition of their faith,
and they assembled to affix their names to the important
document. It was a solemn and trying time. The Reformers
were solicitous that their cause should not be confounded
with political questions; they felt that the Reformation should
exercise no other influence than that which proceeds from
the word of God. As the Christian princes advanced to sign
the Confession, Melancthon interposed, saying, “It is for the
theologians and ministers to propose these things, while the
authority of the mighty ones of earth is to be reserved for
other matters.” “God forbid,” replied John of Saxony, “that
you should exclude me. I am resolved to do my duty without
being troubled about my crown. I desire to confess the Lord.
My electoral hat and robes are not so precious to me as the
cross of Jesus Christ.” Having thus spoken, he wrote down
his name. Said another of the princes as he took the pen, “If
the honor of my Lord Jesus Christ requires it, I am ready
to leave my goods and life behind me.” “Rather would I
renounce my subjects and my States, rather would I quit the
country of my fathers, staff in hand,” he continued, “than to
receive any other doctrine than is contained in this Confession.” Such was the faith and daring of those men of God.
The appointed time came to appear before the emperor. Charles Fifth, seated upon his throne, surrounded
by the electors and the princes, gave audience to the Protestant Reformers. The confession of their faith was read.
In that august assembly the truths of the gospel were clearly
set forth, and the errors of the papal church were pointed
out. Well has that day been pronounced “the greatest
day of the Reformation, and one of the most glorious in the
history of Christianity and of the world.”
But a few years had passed since the monk of
Wittemberg stood alone at Worms before the national
council. Now in his stead were the noblest and most powerful princes of the empire. Luther had been forbidden to

Protest of the Princes

[207-209]

141

appear at Augsburg, but he had been present by his words
and prayers. “I am overjoyed,” he wrote, “that I have lived
until this hour, in which Christ has been publicly exalted by
such illustrious confessors, and in so glorious an assembly.
Herein is fulfilled what the Scripture saith, ‘I will declare
thy testimony in the presence of kings.’ ”
In the days of Paul, the gospel for which he was imprisoned was thus brought before the princes and nobles of the
imperial city. So on this occasion, that which the emperor
had forbidden to be preached from the pulpit, was proclaimed
in the palace; what many had regarded as unfit even for servants to listen to, was heard with wonder by the masters and
lords of the empire. “Kings and great men were the auditory,
crowned princes were the preachers, and the sermon was the
royal truth of God.” “Since the apostolic age,” says a writer,
“there has never been a greater work, or a more magnificent
confession of Jesus Christ.”
“All that the Lutherans have said is true, and we cannot
deny it,” declared a papist bishop. “Can you by sound reasons refute the Confession made by the elector and his
allies?” asked another, of Doctor Eck. “Not with the writings of the apostles and prophets,” was the reply; “but
with the Fathers and councils I can.” “I understand,
then,” responded the questioner, “that the Lutherans are
entrenched in the Scriptures, and we are only outside.”
Some of the princes of Germany were won to the reformed
faith. The emperor himself declared that the Protestant articles were but the truth. The Confession was translated
into many languages, and circulated through all Europe,
and it has been accepted by millions in succeeding generations as the expression of their faith.
God’s faithful builders were not toiling alone. While
“principalities and powers and wicked spirits in high
places” were leagued against them, the Lord did not forsake His people. Could their eyes have been opened, they
would have seen as marked evidence of divine presence and
aid as was granted to a prophet of old. When Elisha’s servant pointed his master to the hostile army surrounding them,

142

The

Great

Controversy

and cutting off all opportunity for escape, the prophet prayed,
“Lord, I pray thee, open his eyes, that he may see.” 2 Kings
6:17. And, lo, the mountain was filled with chariots and
horses of fire, the army of Heaven stationed to protect the
man of God. Thus did angels guard the workers in the cause
of the Reformation. God had commanded His servants to
build, and no opposing force could drive them from the walls.
From the secret place of prayer came the power that
shook the world in the Great Reformation. There, with
holy calmness, the servants of the Lord set their feet upon
the rock of His promises. During the struggle at Augsburg,
Luther did not fail to devote three hours each day to prayer;
and these were taken from that portion of the day most favorable to study. In the privacy of his chamber he was heard
to pour out his soul before God in words full of adoration,
fear, and hope, as if speaking to a friend. “I know that thou
art our Father and our God,” he said, “and that thou wilt
scatter the persecutors of Thy children; for Thou art Thyself
endangered with us. All this matter is thine, and it is only by
Thy constraint that we have put our hands to it. Defend us
then, O Father!” To Melancthon, who was crushed under the
burden of anxiety and fear, he wrote: “Grace and peace in
Christ! In Christ, I say, and not in the world, Amen! I hate
with exceeding hatred those extreme cares which consume you. If the cause is unjust, abandon it; if the cause
is just, why should we belie the promises of Him who
commands us to sleep without fear?” “Christ will not be
wanting to the work of justice and truth. He lives, He reigns;
what fear, then, can we have?”
God did listen to the cries of His servants. He gave to
princes and ministers grace and courage to maintain the
truth against the rulers of the darkness of this world.
Saith the Lord, “Behold, I lay in Zion a chief corner-stone,
elect, precious, and he that believeth on Him shall not be
confounded.” 1 Peter 2:6. The Protestant Reformers had
built on Christ, and the gates of hell could not prevail
against them.

CHAPTER SUPPLEMENT
SUPPLEMENT:: AN OFFICIAL POSITION

“We believe that the rulers of a Catholic country have the right to
restrict the activity of those who would lead their people away from
their allegiance to the Catholic Church . . They possess the right to
prevent propaganda against the Church. This is merely a logical conclusion from the basic Catholic tenet that the Son of God established
one religion and commanded all men to accept it under pain of eternal
damnation.” American Ecclesiastical Review, January, 1946 [Roman
Catholic].
“When you are in a majority we ask for religious liberty in the name
of your principles. When we are in a majority we refuse you in the
name of ours.” Louis Veuillot [French Catholic writer, speaking to a
group of Protestants].
“With all my power, I will persecute and will make war upon all
heretics, schismatics, and those who rebel against our lord [the pope]
and all his successors . . So help me God and these the holy gospels
of God.” Pontificale Romanum Summorum Pontificum.
“Though heretics must not be tolerated because they deserve it,
we must bear with them, till, by a second admonition, they may be
brought back to the faith of the church. But those who, after a second
admonition, remain obstinate in their errors, must not only be excommunicated, but they must be delivered to the secular power to be exterminated.” Thomas Aquinas, Suma Theologica, Vol. IV, p. 90. [This is
the standard Roman Catholic book of theology and church operation.
Only Catholic councils and papal decrees are superior to it.]
“When a religion is good, I conceive that it will support itself; and, when
it cannot support itself, and God does not take care to support, so that its
professors are obliged to call for the help of the civil power, it is a sign, I
apprehend, of its being a bad one.”—Benjamin Franklin, Letter dated October 9, 1780.
“The doctrine which, from the very first origin of religious dissensions,
has been held by all bigots of all sects, when condensed into a few words,
and stripped of rhetorical disguise, is simply this: ‘I am in the right, and you
are in the wrong. When you are the stronger, you ought to tolerate me; for
it is your duty to tolerate truth. But when I am the stronger, I shall persecute
you; for it is my duty to persecute error.’ ” Thomas B. Macaulay.

— The Later Reformers

———————————————————————

One day William TTyndale
yndale said to a learned clergyman, “If God
spare my life, ere many years, I will cause a boy that driveth the
plow to know more of Scripture than you do.” —And he did. For
he gave the first printed English Bible to the world—and was betrayed by a friend for doing it. Tyndale—the man who died that you
might have the Bible —
You will also read about John Knox—the man who feared no
repeatedly,, fearlessly faced the Queen of Scotland,
one; who repeatedly
the woman who had murdered countless Christians before him.
He won Scotland for God. Also John and Charles Wesley who
brought Christ to two continents, and the burning energy of
George Whitefield who could speak to 100,000 people in a field
as if they were but two—and brought millions to repentance —

———————————————————————

While Luther was opening a closed Bible to the people
of Germany Tyndale was impelled by the Spirit of God
to do the same for England. He was a diligent student of
the Scriptures, and fearlessly preached his convictions of
truth, urging that all doctrines be brought to the test of God’s
word. His zeal could not but excite opposition from the papists. A learned Catholic doctor who engaged in controversy
with him exclaimed, “It were better for us to be without God’s
law than without the pope’s.” Tyndale replied, “I defy the
pope and all his laws; and if God spare my life, ere many
years I will cause a boy who driveth the plow to know more
of the Scriptures than you do.”
The purpose which he had begun to cherish, of giving

to the people the New-Testament Scriptures in their own
language, was now confirmed, and he immediately applied himself to the work. Driven from his home by persecution, he went to London, and there for a time pursued his
labors undisturbed. But again the violence of the papists
forced him to flee. All England seemed closed against him,
and he resolved to seek shelter in Germany. Here he began
the printing of the English New Testament. Twice the work
was stopped; but when forbidden to print in one city, he went
to another. At last he made his way to Worms, where, a few
years before, Luther had defended the gospel before the Diet.
In that ancient city were many friends of the Reformation,
and Tyndale there prosecuted his work without further hindrance. Three thousand copies of the New Testament were
soon finished, and another edition followed in the same year.
With great earnestness and perseverance he continued his
labors. Notwithstanding the English authorities had
guarded their ports with the strictest vigilance, the word
of God was in various ways secretly conveyed to London, and thence circulated throughout the country. The
papists attempted to suppress the truth, but in vain. The
bishop of Durham at one time bought of a bookseller who
was a friend of Tyndale, his whole stock of Bibles, for the
purpose of destroying them, supposing that this would greatly
hinder the work. But, on the contrary, the money thus fur———————————

English translation of the New Testament began to be printed in 1526,
and the complete Bible in about 1536, the year he was burned at the
stake. The King James Bible (1611) was 90% unaltered Tyndale translation. The martydoms in England of faithful Protestants continued through
the 1530s to 1560s and beyond—even though Henry VIII repudiated papal supremacy in January 1531. Persecution of Christians continued on
through the 17th century.
Between 1660 and 1675, John Bunyan wrote his books in prison.
John and Charles Wesley, and George Whitfield, brought a major revival
to England. George was converted in 1735, John and Charles in 1738. All
three spent the rest of their lives preaching Christ. Charles wrote 6,000
hymns and John traveled 250,000 miles on horseback from one speaking appointment to the next.

nished, purchased material for a new and better edition,
which, but for this, could not have been published. When
Tyndale was afterward made a prisoner, his liberty was offered him on condition that he would reveal the names of
those who had helped him meet the expense of printing his
Bibles. He replied that the bishop of Durham had done more
than any other person; for by paying a large price for the
books left on hand, he had enabled him to go on with good
courage.
Tyndale was betrayed into the hands of his enemies,
and at one time suffered imprisonment for many months. He
finally witnessed for his faith by a martyr’s death; but the
weapons which he prepared have enabled other soldiers to
do battle through all the centuries even to our time.
In Scotland the gospel found a champion in the person of John Knox. This true-hearted reformer feared not
the face of man. The fires of martyrdom, blazing around
him, served only to quicken his zeal to greater intensity. With
the tyrant’s ax held menacingly over his head, he stood his
ground, striking sturdy blows on the right hand and on the
left, to demolish idolatry. Thus he kept to his purpose, praying and fighting the battles of the Lord, until Scotland was
free.
In England, Latimer maintained from the pulpit that
the Bible ought to be read in the language of the people.
“The Author of Holy Scripture,” said he, “is God Himself,
and this Scripture partakes of the might and eternity of its
Author. There is neither king nor emperor that is not bound
to obey it. Let us beware of those by-paths of human tradition, full of stones, brambles, and uprooted trees. Let us follow the straight road of the word. It does not concern us
what the Fathers have done, but rather what they ought to
have done.”
Barnes and Frith, the faithful friends of Tyndale, arose
to defend the truth. The Ridleys and Cranmer followed.
These leaders in the English Reformation were men of learning, and most of them had been highly esteemed for zeal or
piety in the Romish communion. Their opposition to the

Later

Reformers

[247-251]

147

papacy was the result of their knowledge of the errors of the
holy see. Their acquaintance with the mysteries of Babylon,
gave greater power to their testimonies against her.
“Do you know,” said Latimer, “who is the most diligent bishop in England? I see you listening and hearkening that I should name him. I will tell you It is the
devil. He is never out of his diocese; you shall never find
him idle. Call for him when you will, he is ever at home, he
is ever at the plow. You shall never find him remiss, I warrant you. Where the devil is resident, there away with
books, and up with candles; away with Bibles, and up
with beads; away with the light of the gospel, and up with
the light of wax tapers, yea, at noonday; down with Christ’s
cross, up with the purgatory pick-purse; away with clothing
the naked, the poor, the impotent; up with the decking of
images and the gay garnishing of stones and stocks; down
with God and His most holy word; up with traditions,
human councils, and a blinded pope. Oh that our prelates
would be as diligent to sow the corn of good doctrine as
Satan is to sow cockle and darnel!”
The grand principle maintained by Tyndale, Frith,
Latimer, and the Ridleys, was the divine authority and
sufficiency of the Sacred Scriptures. They rejected the
assumed authority of popes, councils, Fathers, and kings
to rule the conscience in matters of religious faith. The
Bible was their standard, and to this they brought all doctrines and all claims.
Faith in God and His word sustained these holy men as
they yielded up their lives at the stake. “Be of good comfort,” exclaimed Latimer to his fellow-martyr as the
flames were about to silence their voices, “we shall this
day light such a candle in England as, I trust, by God’s
grace shall never be put out.”
The Church of England, following in the steps of Rome,
persecuted dissenters from the established faith. In the
seventeenth century thousands of godly pastors were expelled
from their positions. The people were forbidden, on pain
of heavy fines, imprisonment, and banishment, to attend

148

The

Great

Controversy

any religious meetings except such as were sanctioned
by the church. Those faithful souls who could not refrain
from gathering to worship God, were compelled to meet in
dark alleys, in obscure garrets, and at some seasons in the
woods at midnight. In the sheltering depths of the forest, a
temple of God’s own building, those scattered and persecuted children of the Lord assembled to pour out their souls
in prayer and praise. But despite all their precautions, many
suffered for their faith. The jails were crowded. Families were
broken up. Many were banished to foreign lands. Yet God
was with His people, and persecution could not prevail to
silence their testimony. Many were driven across the ocean
to America, and here laid the foundations of civil and
religious liberty which have been the bulwark and glory
of our country.
As in apostolic days, the persecution turned out rather to
the furtherance of the gospel. In a loathsome dungeon
crowded with profligates and felons, John Bunyan breathed
the very atmosphere of Heaven, and there he wrote his
wonderful allegory of the pilgrim’s journey from the land
of destruction to the celestial city. For two hundred years
that voice from Bedford jail has spoken with thrilling power
to the hearts of men. Bunyan’s “Pilgrim’s Progress” and
“Grace Abounding to the Chief of Sinners,” have guided
many feet into the path of life.
Baxter, Flavel, Alleine, and other men of talent, education, and deep Christian experience, stood up in valiant defense of “the faith once delivered to the saints.”
The work accomplished by these men, proscribed and outlawed by the rulers of this world, can never perish. Flavel’s
“Fountain of Life” and “Method of Grace” have taught
thousands how to commit the keeping of their souls to Christ.
Baxter’s “Reformed Pastor” has proved a blessing to many
who desire a revival of the work of God, and his “Saints’
Everlasting Rest” has done its work in leading souls to the
“rest that remaineth for the people of God.”
A hundred years later, in a day of great spiritual darkness, Whitefield and the Wesleys appeared as light-bear-

Later

[251-257]

ers for God. Under the rule of the established church, the
people of England had lapsed into a state of religious declension hardly to be distinguished from heathenism. Natural religion was the favorite study of the clergy, and included
most of their theology. The higher classes sneered at piety,
and prided themselves on being above what they called its
fanaticism. The lower classes were grossly ignorant, and
abandoned to vice, while the church had no courage or faith
to any longer support the downfallen cause of truth.
Whitefield and the Wesleys were prepared for their
work by long and sharp personal convictions of their
own lost condition; and that they might be able to endure
hardness as good soldiers of Christ, they were subjected to
the fiery ordeal of scorn, derision, and persecution, both in
the university and as they were entering the ministry. They
and a few others who sympathized with them were contemptuously called Methodists by their ungodly fellowstudents,—a name which is at the present time regarded as
honorable by one of the largest denominations in England
and America.
They were members of the Church of England, and were
strongly attached to her forms of worship; but the Lord had
presented before them in His word a higher standard. The
Holy Spirit urged them to preach Christ and Him crucified.
The power of the Highest attended their labors. Thousands were convicted and truly converted. It was necessary that these sheep be protected from ravening wolves.
Wesley had no thought of forming a new denomination, but
he organized them under what was called the Methodist Connection.
Mysterious and trying was the opposition which these
preachers encountered from the established church; yet God,
in His wisdom, had overruled events to cause the reform to
begin where it did. Had it come wholly from without, it would
not have penetrated where it was so much needed. As the
revival preachers were churchmen, and labored within the
pale of the church wherever they could find opportunity, the
truth had an entrance where the doors would otherwise have

150

The

Great

Controversy

remained closed. Some of the clergy were roused from
their moral stupor, and became zealous preachers in their
own parishes. The churches that had been petrified by formalism were quickened into life.
Men of different gifts performed their appointed work.
They did not harmonize upon every point of doctrine, but all
were moved by the Spirit of God, and united in the absorbing aim to win souls to Christ. The differences between
Whitefield and the Wesleys threatened at one time to create
alienation; but as they learned meekness in the school of
Christ, mutual forbearance and charity reconciled them. They
had no time to dispute, while error and iniquity were teeming everywhere, and sinners were going down to ruin. They
labored and prayed together, and their friendship was
strengthened as they sowed the gospel seed in the same fields.
The servants of God trod a rugged path. Men of influence
and learning employed their powers against them. After a
time many of the clergy manifested determined hostility,
and the doors of the churches were closed against a pure
faith and those who proclaimed it. The course of the clergy
in denouncing them from the pulpit, aroused the elements of
darkness, ignorance, and iniquity. Again and again did John
Wesley escape death by a miracle of God’s mercy. When
the rage of the mob was excited against him, and there seemed
no way of escape, an angel in human form came to his side,
the mob fell back, and the servant of Christ passed in safety
from the place of danger.
The Methodists of those early days—people as well as
preachers—endured ridicule and persecution, alike from
church-members and from the openly irreligious who were
inflamed by their misrepresentations. They were arraigned
before courts of justice—such only in name, for justice had
no place in the courts of that time. Often they suffered violence from their persecutors. Mobs went from house to
house, destroying furniture and goods, plundering whatever they chose, and brutally abusing men, women, and
children. In some instances, public notices were posted, calling upon those who desired to assist in breaking the win-

dows and robbing the houses of the Methodists to assemble
at a given time and place. These open violations of all law,
human and divine, were allowed to pass without a reprimand.
A systematic persecution was carried on against a people
whose only fault was that of seeking to turn the feet of
sinners from the path of destruction to the path of holiness.
Said John Wesley, referring to the charges against himself and his associates: “Some allege that the doctrines of
these men are false, erroneous, and enthusiastic; that they
are new and unheard-of till of late; that they are Quakerism,
fanaticism, popery. This whole pretense has been already cut
up by the roots, it having been shown at large that every
branch of this doctrine is the plain doctrine of Scripture interpreted by our own church. Therefore it cannot be false or
erroneous, provided the Scripture be true.” “Others allege
that their doctrines are too strict; they make the way to
Heaven too narrow; and this is in truth the original objection, as it was almost the only one for some time, and
is secretly at the bottom of a thousand more which appear in various forms. But do they make the way to Heaven
any narrower than our Lord and His apostles made it? Is
their doctrine stricter than that of the Bible? Consider only a
few plain texts: ‘Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all
thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and
with all thy mind; and thy neighbor as thyself.’ Luke 10:27.
‘Every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of Judgment.’ Matthew 12:36.
‘Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do
all to the glory of God.’ 1 Corinthians 10:31.
“If their doctrine is stricter than this, they are to blame;
but you know in your conscience it is not. And who can be
one jot less strict without corrupting the word of God? Can
any steward of the mysteries of God be found faithful if he
change any part of that sacred deposition?—No; he can abate
nothing; he can soften nothing; he is constrained to declare
to all men, I may not bring down the Scriptures to your taste.
You must come up to it, or perish forever. The popular cry

152

The

Great

Controversy

is, The uncharitableness of these men! Uncharitable, are they?
In what respect? Do they not feed the hungry and clothe the
naked? No; that is not the thing; they are not wanting in this,
but they are so uncharitable in judging; they think none can
be saved but those who are of their own way.”
How similar are the arguments urged against those who
present the truths of God’s word applicable to this time.
Among the reformers of the church an honorable place
should be given to those who stood in vindication of a
truth generally ignored, even by Protestants,—those who
maintained the validity of the fourth commandment, and
the obligation of the Bible Sabbath. When the Reformation swept back the darkness that had rested down on all
Christendom, Sabbath-keepers were brought to light in
many lands. No class of Christians have been treated with
greater injustice by popular historians than have those
who honored the Sabbath. They have been stigmatized as
semi-Judaizers, or denounced as superstitious and fanatical.
The arguments which they presented from the Scriptures in
support of their faith were met as such arguments are still
met, with the cry, The Fathers, the Fathers! ancient tradition,
the authority of the church!
Luther and his co-laborers accomplished a noble work
for God; but, coming as they did from the Roman Church,
having themselves believed and advocated her doctrines,
it was not to be expected that they would discern all these
errors. It was their work to break the fetters of Rome, and to
give the Bible to the world; yet there were important truths
which they failed to discover, and grave errors which
they did not renounce. Most of them continued to observe the Sunday with other papal festivals. They did not,
indeed, regard it as possessing divine authority, but believed
that it should be observed as a generally accepted day of
worship.
There were some among them, however, who honored
the Sabbath of the fourth commandment. Such was the
belief and practice of Carlstadt, and there were others who
united with him. John Frith, who aided Tyndale in the trans-

Later Reformers

lation of the Scriptures, and who was martyred for his faith,
thus states his views respecting the Sabbath: “The Jews have
the word of God for their Saturday, since it is the seventh
day, and they were commanded to keep the seventh day solemn. And we have not the word of God for us, but rather
against us; for we keep not the seventh day, as the Jews do,
but the first, which is not commanded by God’s law.”
A hundred years later, John Trask acknowledged the
obligation of the true Sabbath, and employed voice and
pen in its defense. He was soon called to account by the
persecuting power of the Church of England. He declared
the sufficiency of the Scriptures as a guide for religious faith,
and maintained that civil authorities should not control the
conscience in matters which concern salvation. He was
brought for trial before the infamous tribunal of the Star
Chamber, where a long discussion was held respecting the
Sabbath. Trask would not depart from the injunctions and
commandments of God to obey the commandments of men.
He was therefore condemned, and sentenced to be set upon
the pillory, and thence to be publicly whipped to the fleet,
there to remain a prisoner. This cruel sentence was executed,
and after a time his spirit was broken. He endured his sufferings in the prison for one year, and then recanted. Oh that he
had suffered on, and won a martyr’s crown!
The wife of Trask was also a Sabbath-keeper. She was
declared, even by her enemies, to be a woman endowed with
many virtues worthy of the imitation of all Christians. She
was a school-teacher of acknowledged excellence, and was
noted for her carefulness in dealing with the poor. “This,”
said her enemies, “she professed to do out of conscience, as
believing she must one day come to be judged for all things
done in the flesh. Therefore she resolved to go by the safest
rule, rather against than for her private interest.” Yet it was
declared that she possessed a spirit of strange, unparalleled
obstinacy in adhering to her own opinions, which spoiled
her. In truth, she chose to obey the word of God in preference to the traditions of men. At last this noble woman was
seized and thrust into prison. The charge brought against

154

The

Great

Controversy

her was that she taught only five days in the week, and rested
on Saturday, it being known that she did it in obedience to
the fourth commandment. She was accused of no crime; the
motive of her act was the sole ground of complaint.
She was often visited by her persecutors, who employed
their most wily arguments to induce her to renounce her faith.
In reply, she begged them to show from the Scriptures that
she was in error, and urged that if Sunday were really a holy
day, the fact must be stated in the word of God. But in vain
she asked for Bible testimony. She was exhorted to smother
her convictions, and believe what the church declared to be
right.
She refused to purchase liberty by renouncing the
truth. The promises of God sustained her faith: “Fear none
of those things which thou shalt suffer. Behold, the devil
shall cast some of you into prison that ye may be tried.” “Be
thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life.”
Revelation 2:10. For nearly sixteen years this feeble woman
remained a prisoner, in privation and great suffering. The
book of God alone can testify what she endured during those
weary years. Faithfully she witnessed for the truth; her patience and fortitude failed not until she was released by death.
Her name was cast out as evil on earth, but it is honored
in the heavenly records. She was registered among the number who have been hunted, maligned, cast out, imprisoned,
martyred; “of whom the world was not worthy.” “And they
shall be mine, saith the Lord of hosts, in that day when I
make up my jewels.” Malachi 3:17.
God has, in His providence, preserved the history of
a few of those who suffered for their obedience to the
fourth commandment; but there were many, of whom
the world knows nothing, who for the same truth endured
persecution and martyrdom. Those who oppressed these
followers of Christ called themselves Protestants; but they
abjured the fundamental principle of Protestantism,—the
Bible and the Bible only as the rule of faith and practice.
The testimony of the Scriptures they thrust from them with
disdain. This spirit still lives, and it will increase more and

Later Reformers

more as we near the close of time. Those who honor the
Bible Sabbath are even now pronounced willful and stubborn by a large share of the Christian world, and the
time is not far distant when the spirit of persecution will
be manifested against them.
In the seventeenth century there were several Sabbatarian churches in England, while there were hundreds of
Sabbath-keepers scattered throughout the country. Through
their labors this truth was planted in America at an early
date. Less than half a century after the landing of the pilgrims at Plymouth, the Sabbath-keepers of London sent one
of their number to raise the standard of Sabbath reform in
the new world. This missionary held that the ten commandments as they were delivered from Mount Sinai are moral
and immutable, and that it was the antichristian power which
thought to change times and laws, that had changed the Sabbath from the seventh to the first day. In Newport, R. I., several church-members embraced these views, yet continued
for some years in the church with which they had previously
been connected. Finally there arose difficulty between the
Sabbatarians and the Sunday observers, and the former were
compelled to withdraw from the church, that they might
peaceably keep God’s holy day. Soon after, they entered into
an organization, thus forming the first Sabbath-keeping
church in America. These Sabbath-keepers had flattered
themselves that they could obey the fourth commandment and yet remain connected with Sunday observers.
It was a blessing to them and to after-generations that such a
union could not exist; for had it continued, it would eventually have caused the light of God’s holy Sabbath to go out in
darkness.
Some years later, a church was formed in New Jersey. A
zealous observer of Sunday, having reproved a person for
laboring on that day, was asked for his authority from the
Scriptures. On searching for this he found, instead, the divine command for keeping the seventh day, and he began at
once to observe it. Through his labors a Sabbatarian church
was raised up.

156

The

Great

Controversy

From that time the work gradually extended, until thousands began the observance of the Sabbath. Among the Seventh-day Baptists of this country have been men eminent for
talent, learning, and piety. They have accomplished a great
and good work as they have stood for two hundred years in
defense of the ancient Sabbath.
In the present century few have taken a nobler stand for
this truth than was taken by Eld. J. W. Morton, whose labors
and writings in favor of the Sabbath have led many to its
observance. He was sent as a missionary to Haiti by the Reformed Presbyterians. Sabbatarian publications fell into his
hands, and after giving the subject a careful examination, he
became satisfied that the fourth commandment requires the
observance of the seventh-day Sabbath. Without waiting to
consider his own interests, he immediately determined to obey
God. He returned home, made known his faith, was tried for
heresy, and expelled from the Reformed Presbyterian Church
without being allowed to present the reasons for his position.
The course of the Presbyterian synod in condemning Eld.
Morton without granting him a hearing, is an evidence of the
spirit of intolerance which still exists, even among those
claiming to be Protestant reformers. The infinite God, whose
throne is in the heavens, condescends to address His people,
“Come now, and let us reason together.” Isaiah 1:18. But
frail, erring men proudly refuse to reason with their brethren. They stand ready to censure one who accepts any light
which they have not received—as though God had pledged
Himself to give no more light to any one than He had given
to them. This is the course pursued by opposers of the truth
in every age. They forget the declaration of the Scriptures,
“Light is sown for the righteous.” Psalm 97:11. “The path
of the just is as the shining light, that shineth more and more
unto the perfect day.” Proverbs 4:18. It is a sad thing when a
people claiming to be reformers cease to reform.
If professed Christians would but carefully and
prayerfully compare their views with the Scriptures, laying aside all pride of opinion and desire for the supremacy,

Later Reformers

157

a flood of light would be shed upon the churches now
wandering in the darkness of error. As fast as His people
can bear it, the Lord reveals to them their errors in doctrine
and their defects of character. From age to age He has raised
up men and qualified them to do a special work needed in
their time. But to none of these did He commit all the light
which was to be given to the world. Wisdom does not die
with them. It was not the will of God that the work of
reform should cease with the going out of Luther’s life;
it was not His will that at the death of the Wesleys the
Christian faith should become stereotyped. The work of
reform is progressive. Go forward, is the command of our
great Leader,—forward unto victory.
We shall not be accepted and honored of God in doing the
same work that our fathers did. We do not occupy the position which they occupied in the unfolding of truth. In order
to be accepted and honored as they were, we must improve
the light which shines upon us, as they improved that which
shone upon them; we must do as they would have done, had
they lived in our day. Luther and the Wesleys were reformers in their time. It is our duty to continue the work
of reform. If we neglect to heed the light, it will become
darkness; and the degree of darkness will be proportionate
to the light rejected.
The prophet of God declares that in the last days knowledge shall be increased. There are new truths to be revealed
to the humble seeker. The teachings of God’s word are to be
freed from the errors and superstition with which they have
been encumbered. Doctrines that are not sanctioned by
the Scriptures have been widely taught, and many have
honestly accepted them; but when the truth is revealed,
it becomes the duty of every one to accept it. Those who
allow worldly interests, desire for popularity, or pride of opinion, to separate them from the truth, must render an account
to God for their neglect.

well with them that fear God, which fear before Him.” Ecclesiastes 8:12.

The suppression of the Scriptures under the dominion of
Rome, the terrible results of that suppression, and the final
exaltation of the word of God, are vividly portrayed by the
prophetic pencil. To John the exile on lonely Patmos was
given a view of the 1260 years during which the papal
power was permitted to trample upon God’s word and
oppress His people. Said the angel of the Lord: “The holy
city [the true church] shall they tread under foot forty and
two months. And I will give power unto My two witnesses,
and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and threescore days, clothed in sackcloth.” Revelation 11:2, 3. The
periods here mentioned are the same, alike representing the
time in which God’s faithful witnesses remained in a state of
obscurity.
The two witnesses represent the Old and New Testament Scriptures. Both are important testimonies to the
origin and perpetuity of the law of God. Both are witnesses also to the plan of salvation. The types, sacrifices,
and prophecies of the Old Testament point forward to a Sav-

iour to come. The Gospels and Epistles of the New Testament tell of a Saviour who has come in the exact manner
foretold by type and prophecy.
“These are the two olive trees, and the two candlesticks
standing before the God of the earth.” Revelation 11:4. Said
the psalmist, “Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light
unto my path.” Psalm 119:105.
The papal power sought to hide from the people the
word of truth, and set before them false witnesses to contradict its testimony. When the Bible was proscribed by
religious and secular authority; when its testimony was perverted, and every effort made that men and demons could
invent to turn the minds of the people from it; when those
who dared proclaim its sacred truths were hunted, betrayed,
tortured, buried in dungeon cells, martyred for their faith, or
compelled to flee to mountain fastnesses and to dens and

among the nations of Europe. After being initially tolerated, Protestantism
was later thoroughly crushed out. By 1559, there were 400,000 Huguenots (French Protestants) in France. In three savage “Huguenot Wars”
(1562-1570), the Catholics tried unsuccessfully to exterminate the Protestants. From 1560 onward (as they were doing elsewhere in Europe), the
Jesuits led out in this work.
Catherine de’Medici of France was told by her Jesuit confessor that
her sins would be forgiven if she killed all the Protestants. On St.
Bartholomew’s Day, August 24, 1572, the horrible work began, and continued for two months—resulting in the death of 70,000 Protestants. Pope
Gregory XIII was utterly delighted. The killing of Protestants continued to
1580. Charles IX, only 23 years old in 1572, continually heard the cries of
the dying in his ears, and he sickened and died 21 months later.
With the Protestants, the nation’s best workers, gone—the nation
became more and more corrupt. In 1789, Louis XVI called the EstatesGeneral to keep the country from bankruptcy. The French Revolution resulted.
In July 1789, riots began throughout the nation. The Reign of Terror
continued until 1794, as over 300,000 citizens were slain. War between
France and other nations was almost continuous from 1793 to 1915.
The “Festival of Reason” occurred in November 1793. Voltaire said
he had destroyed Christianity, but his house was later used to store French
Bibles.

caves of the earth,—then indeed did the faithful witnesses
prophesy in sackcloth.
But men cannot with impunity trample upon the word
of God. The Lord had declared concerning His two witnesses,
“If any man will hurt them, fire proceedeth out of their mouth,
and devoureth their enemies: and if any man will hurt them,
he must in this manner be killed.” Revelation 11:5. The meaning of this fearful denunciation is set forth in the closing
chapter of the book of Revelation: “I testify unto every man
that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, If any
man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the
plagues that are written in this book. And if any man shall
take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God
shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the
holy city, and from the things which are written in this book.”
Revelation 22:18, 19.
Such are the warnings which God has given to guard men
against changing in any manner that which He has revealed
or commanded. These solemn denunciations apply to all
who by their influence lead men to lightly regard the law
of God. They should cause those to fear and tremble who
flippantly declare it a matter of little consequence whether
we obey God’s law or not. All who exalt their own opinions
above the written word, all who would change the plain meaning of Scripture to suit their own convenience, or for the
sake of conformity to the world, are taking upon themselves
a fearful responsibility. The written word, the law of God,
will measure the character of every man, and condemn all
whom this unerring test shall declare wanting.
Notwithstanding the Lord’s witnesses were clothed in
sackcloth, they continued to prophesy throughout the
entire period of 1260 years. In the darkest times there were
faithful men who loved God’s word, and were jealous for
His honor. To these loyal servants were given wisdom, power,
and authority to declare His truth during the whole of this
time.

“Daniel spake and said, I saw in my vision by night, and, behold, the four
winds of the heaven strove upon the great sea. And four great beasts came up
from the sea, diverse one from another . .
“And behold a fourth beast, dreadful and terrible, and strong exceedingly;
and it had great iron teeth . . and it had ten horns.
“And I considered the horns, and, behold, there came up among them another little horn, before whom there were three of the first horns plucked up by
the roots: and, behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of a man, and a mouth
speaking great things . .
“I came near unto one of them that stood by, and asked him the truth of all
this. So he told me, and made me know the interpretation of the things . . Then I
would know the truth of the fourth beast . . And of the ten horns that there were
in his head, and of the other which came up, and before whom three fell; even of
that horn that had eyes, and a mouth speaking great things, whose look was
more stout than his fellows.
“I beheld, and the same horn made war with the saints, and prevailed against
them . .
“And he shall speak great words against the most High, and shall wear out
the saints of the most High, and think to change time and laws: and they shall be
given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time.” Daniel 7:2-3,

“And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out of the sea

The Bible predicted that the terrible little horn power of Daniel 7 and 8
was to rule the world for 1260 years. It has been well-known for centuries
that this little horn of Daniel 7 and the first beast of Revelation 13 symbolize
the papacy. Also called the “man of sin” (2 Thessalonians 2:3-4) and the
“antichrist” (1 John 4:3), the papacy was definitely prophesied to have this
power for 1260 years. When did this predicted time span begin and when
did it end? The next page will give you this information.

THE AMAZING 1260 YEAR PROPHECY
Here is the amazing prophecy of the 1260 days, also called the “time and
times and the dividing of time,” and the “forty-two months.”
A day stands for a year in Bible prophecy (Numbers 14:34, Ezekiel 4:6).
A “time” in prophecy is the same as a year (Daniel 11:13, margin and Revised
Version). This time-span prophecy is first mentioned in Daniel 7:25, where we
are told that it is the length of time that the terrible “little horn” power was to
bear rule and destroy God’s people. During that time it would also try to change
God’s law: “And he [the little horn] shall speak great words against the most
High, and shall wear out the saints of the most High, and think to change times
and laws: and they shall be given into his hand for a time and times and a
dividing of time.” Daniel 7:25.
This, in Hebrew, equals a time, 2 times and a half a time. Using the
ancient reckoning of 360 days to a year, 360 +180 + 720 = 1260. And since
a day is equivalent to a year in Bible prophecy, this little horn power would rule
for 1260 years. In Revelation 12:6-7 we are told that the persecution would
continue for “a thousand two hundred and threescore days,” which is 1260
prophetic days, or years (also note Revelation 11:3).
The God of heaven gave this important prophecy in yet a third way: The
little horn of Daniel 7 and 8 is the same as the first beast of Revelation 13: “And
there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies; and
power was given unto him to continue forty and two months.” Revelation 13:5
(compare Revelation 11:2). Forty-two months equals 1260 days. And Revelation also calls this time prophecy the “time, and times, and half a time” (Revelation 12:14),—just as Daniel does.
When did the little horn, symbolizing the papacy, have this rule? The
decree of the emperor Justinian, in A.D. 533, recognized the pope as the “head
of all the holy churches” (Code of Justinian, Book 1, title 1, section 4). The
overwhelming defeat of the Ostrogoths in the siege of Rome, just five years
later (A.D. 538) was a death blow to the third of the three horns that were
uprooted (see Daniel 7:8). With the year 538, then begins the 1260 years of
this prophecy of papal domination, which would extend to 1798. In that year
as the Reign of Terror continued in the French Revolution and the Roman Catholic
religion was set aside in France, the French army, under Berthier, entered Rome
and took the pope prisoner. The date: February 10, 1798. The imprisoned pope
died in exile the following year in Valence, France. A great cry was heard,
“Catholicism is dead.” The papacy had received the “deadly wound” of Revelation 13:3. But we are told that the wound is to be healed, and that time is
coming when all the world will “wonder after the beast” (Revelation 13:3).

war against them, and shall overcome them, and kill them.
And their dead bodies shall lie in the street of the great city,
which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also our
Lord was crucified.” Revelation 11:7, 8.
These events were to take place near the close of the period in which the witnesses testified in sackcloth. Through
the medium of the papacy, Satan had long controlled the
powers that ruled in Church and State. The fearful results were specially apparent in those countries that rejected the light of the Reformation. There was a state of
moral debasement and corruption similar to the condition of
Sodom just prior to its destruction, and to the idolatry and
spiritual darkness that prevailed in Egypt in the days of
Moses.
In no land had the spirit of enmity against Christ and
the truth been more strikingly displayed than in giddy
and godless France. Nowhere had the gospel encountered
more bitter and cruel opposition. In the streets of Paris, Christ
had indeed been crucified in the person of His saints. The
world still recalls with shuddering horror the scenes of
that most cowardly and cruel onslaught, the Massacre
of St. Bartholomew. The king of France, urged on by Romish
priests and prelates, lent his sanction to the dreadful work.
The palace bell, tolling at midnight, gave the signal for the
slaughter to begin. Protestants by thousands, sleeping quietly in their homes, trusting to the plighted honor of their
king, were dragged forth without a warning, and murdered
in cold blood.
Satan, in the person of the Roman zealots, led the van. As
Christ was the invisible leader of His people from Egyptian
bondage, so was Satan the unseen leader of his subjects in
this horrible work of multiplying martyrs. For three days the
butchery went on; more than thirty thousand perished. The
result caused great joy to the hosts of darkness. The Roman
pontiff, sharing in the diabolical rejoicing, proclaimed a jubilee to be observed throughout his dominions, to celebrate
the event.
The same master-spirit that urged in the Massacre of

St. Bartholomew, led also in the scenes of the French
Revolution. Satan seemed to triumph. Notwithstanding the
labors of the Reformers, he had succeeded in holding vast
multitudes in ignorance concerning God and His word. Now
he appeared in a new guise. In France arose an atheistical
power that openly declared war against the authority of
Heaven. Men threw off all restraint. The law of God was
trampled under foot. Those who could engage in the most
Heaven-daring blasphemy and the most abominable wickedness were most highly exalted. Fornication was sanctioned
by law. Profanity and corruption seemed deluging the earth.
In all this, supreme homage was paid to Satan, while Christ,
in His characteristics of truth, purity, and unselfish love, was
crucified. The Bible was publicly burned. The Sabbath was
blotted out. Romanism had enjoined image worship; now
divine honors were paid to the vilest objects. The work which
the papacy had begun, atheism completed. The one withheld from the people the truths of the Bible; the other
taught them to reject both the Bible and its Author. The
seed sown by priests and prelates was yielding its evil fruit.
Terrible indeed was the condition of infidel France. The
word of truth lay dead in her streets, and those who hated
the restrictions and requirements of God’s law were jubilant. But transgression and rebellion were followed by
the sure result. Unhappy France reaped in blood the harvest she had sown. The war against the Bible and the law of
God banished peace and happiness from the hearts and homes
of men. No one was secure: he who triumphed to-day was
suspected, condemned, to-morrow. Violence and terror
reigned supreme. The land was filled with crimes too horrible for pen to trace.
God’s faithful witnesses were not long to remain silent.
“The Spirit of life from God entered into them, and they
stood upon their feet, and great fear fell upon them which
saw them.” Revelation 11:11. The world stood aghast at the
enormity of guilt which had resulted from a rejection of the
Sacred Oracles, and men were glad to return once more to

166

The

faith in God and His word.
Concerning the two witnesses the prophet declares further, “And they heard a great voice from Heaven saying unto
them, Come up hither. And they ascended up to heaven in a
cloud; and their enemies beheld them.” Revelation 11:12.
Since the French Revolution the word of God has been
honored as never before. The Bible has been translated
into nearly every language spoken by men, and scattered over
every part of the globe. After being, as it were, thrust down
to hell, it has, in truth, been exalted to heaven.

“That the church of Rome has shed more innocent blood than any other institution that has ever existed among mankind, will be questioned by no Protestant who
has a competent knowledge of history . . It is impossible to form a complete conception of the multitude of her victims, and it quite certain that no powers of imagination
can adequately realize their sufferings.” W.E.H. Lecky, History of the Rise and Influence of the Spirit of Rationalism in Europe, Vol. 2, p. 32, 1910 ed. [An excellent,

do this, will be found in The Catholic Encyclopedia, Vol. 12, p. 266.]
“For professing faith contrary to the teachings of the Church of Rome, history
records the martyrdom of more than one hundred million people. A million Waldenses
and Albigenses [Swiss and French Protestants] perished during a crusade proclaimed
by Pope Innocent III in 1208. Beginning from the establishment of the Jesuits in 1540
to 1580, nine hundred thousand were destroyed. One hundred and fifty thousand
perished by the Inquisition in thirty years. Within the space of thirty-eight years after
the edict of Charles V against the Protestants, fity thousand persons were hanged,
beheaded, or burned alive for heresy. Eighteen thousand more perished during the
administration of the Duke of Alva in five and a half years.” Brief Bible Readings, p.

“The Catholic has some reason on his side when he calls for the temporal punishment of heretics, for he claims the true title of Christian for himself exclusively,
and professes to be taught by the never-failing presence of the Spirit of God . . It is
not more ‘morally’ wrong to put a man to death for heresy than for murder . . [and] in

“ ‘The church,’ said [Martin] Luther, . . ‘has never burned a heretic’ . . I reply that
this argument proves not the opinion, but the ignorance or impudence of Luther.
Since almost infinite numbers were either burned or otherwise killed, Luther either
did not know it, and was therefore ignorant, or if he was not ignorant, he is convicted
of impudence and falsehood; for that heretics were often burned by the church may
be proved if we adduce a few examples.” Robert Bellarmine, Disputationes de

— God Honors the Humble

———————————————————————

We are nearing the end of time. Thinking men ever
everywhere
ywhere
recognize it. Yet how few are getting ready for what is coming so
rapidly upon the earth.
It is vital that we daily surrender our lives into God’s hands,
so He may guide us. We dare not fall away into apostasy —

———————————————————————

Those who received the great blessings of the Reformation did not go forward in the path so nobly entered
upon by Luther. A few faithful men arose from time to time,
to proclaim new truth, and expose long-cherished error; but
the majority, like the Jews in Christ’s day, or the papists
in the time of Luther, were content to believe as their
fathers believed, and to live as they lived. Therefore religion again degenerated into formalism; and errors and superstitions which would have been cast aside had the church
continued to walk in the light of God’s word, were retained
and cherished. Thus the spirit inspired by the Reformation
gradually died out, until there was almost as great need of
reform in the Protestant churches as in the Roman Church in
the time of Luther. There was the same spiritual stupor, the
same respect for the opinions of men, the same spirit of worldliness, the same substitution of human theories for the teachings of God’s word. Pride and extravagance were fostered
under the guise of religion. The churches became corrupted
by allying themselves with the world. Thus were degraded
the great principles for which Luther and his fellow-laborers
had done and suffered so much.
As Satan saw that he had failed to crush out the truth

God

Honors

the

Humble

[289-308]

169

by persecution, he again resorted to the same plan of
compromise which had led to the great apostasy and the
formation of the church of Rome. He induced Christians
to ally themselves, not now with pagans, but with those who,
by their worship of the god of this world, as truly proved
themselves idolaters. Satan could no longer keep the Bible
from the people; it had been placed within the reach of
all. But he led thousands to accept false interpretations
and unsound theories, without searching the Scriptures to
learn the truth for themselves. He had corrupted the doctrines of the Bible, and traditions which were to ruin millions were taking deep root. The church was upholding and
defending these traditions, instead of contending for the faith
once delivered to the saints.
And while wholly unconscious of their condition and
their peril, the church and the world were rapidly approaching the most solemn and momentous period of
earth’s history,—the period of the revelation of the Son of
man. Already had the signs which Christ Himself had promised,—the sun clothed in darkness by day and the moon by
night,—declared His coming near. When Jesus pointed His
followers to these signs, He foretold also the existing state
of worldliness and backsliding, and gave warning of the result to those who refused to arouse from their careless security: “Thou hast a name that thou livest, and art dead.” “If
therefore thou shalt not watch, I will come on thee as a thief,
and thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon thee.”
Revelation 3:1, 3.
He who knows the end from the beginning, and who
inspired prophets and apostles to write the future history of churches and of nations, was about to accomplish another reform similar to that of the days of Luther.
The Lord raised up men to investigate His word, to examine
the foundation upon which the Christian world were building, and to raise the solemn inquiry, What is truth? Are we
building upon the rock, or upon shifting sand?
God saw that many of His professed people were not
building for eternity; and in His care and love He was

170

The

Great

Controversy

about to send a message of warning to arouse them from
their stupor, and prepare them for the coming of their
Lord. The warning was not to be intrusted to learned doctors of divinity or popular ministers of the gospel. Had these
been faithful watchmen, diligently and prayerfully searching the Scriptures, they would have known the time of night;
the prophecies of Daniel and John would have revealed to
them the great events about to take place. If they had faithfully followed the light already given, some star of heavenly
radiance would have been sent to guide them into all truth.
At the time of Christ’s first advent, the priests and
scribes of the holy city, to whom were intrusted the
oracles of God, should have discerned the signs of the
times, and proclaimed the coming of the Promised One.
The prophecy of Micah designated His birthplace. Micah
5:2. Daniel specified the time of His advent. Daniel 9:25.
God had committed these prophecies to the Jewish leaders;
therefore they were without excuse if they did not know and
declare to the people that the Messiah’s coming was at hand.
Their ignorance was the result of sinful neglect.
God did not send His messengers to the palaces of kings,
to the assemblies of philosophers, or to the schools of the
rabbis, to make known the wonderful fact that the Redeemer
of men was about to appear upon the earth. The Jews were
building monuments for the slain prophets of God, while
by their deference to the great men of the earth they were
paying homage to the servants of Satan. Absorbed in their
ambitious strife for place and power among men, they lost
sight of the divine honors proffered them by the King of
Heaven.
With what profound and reverent interest should the
elders of Israel have been studying the place, the time,
the circumstances, of the greatest event in the world’s
history,—the coming of the Son of God to accomplish
the redemption of man! Oh, why were not the people watching and waiting that they might be among the first to welcome the world’s Redeemer! But lo, at Bethlehem two weary
travelers from the hills of Nazareth traverse the whole length

God

Honors

the

[308-214]

171

of the narrow street to the eastern extremity of the town,
vainly seeking a place of rest and shelter for the night. No
doors are open to receive them. In a wretched hovel prepared for cattle, they at last find refuge, and there the Saviour of the world is born.
Heavenly angels had seen the glory which the Son of God
shared with the Father before the world was, and they had
looked forward with intense interest to His appearance on
earth as an event fraught with the greatest joy to all people.
Angels were appointed to carry the glad tidings to those who
were prepared to receive it, and who would joyfully make it
known to the inhabitants of the earth. Christ has stooped to
take upon Himself man’s nature; He is to bear an infinite
weight of woe as He shall make His soul an offering for sin;
yet angels desire that even in His humiliation, the Son of the
Highest may appear before men with a dignity and glory
befitting His character. Will the great men of earth assemble
at Israel’s capital to greet His coming? Will legions of angels present Him to the expectant company?
An angel visits the earth to see who are prepared to welcome Jesus. But he can discern no tokens of expectancy. He
hears no voice of praise and triumph that the period of the
Messiah’s coming is at hand. The angel hovers for a time
over the chosen city and the temple where the divine presence was manifested for ages; but even here is the same indifference. The priests, in their pomp and pride, are offering
polluted sacrifices in the temple. The Pharisees are with loud
voices addressing the people, or making boastful prayers at
the corners of the streets. There is no evidence that Christ is
expected, and no preparation for the Prince of life.
In amazement the celestial messenger is about to return
to Heaven with the shameful tidings, when he discovers a
group of shepherds who are watching their flocks by night,
and, as they gaze into the starry heavens, are contemplating
the prophecy of a Messiah to come to earth, and longing for
the advent of the world’s Redeemer. Here is a company that
can be trusted with the heavenly message. And suddenly the
angel of the Lord appeared, declaring the good tidings of

172

The

Great

Controversy

great joy. Celestial glory flooded all the plain, an innumerable company of angels were revealed, and as if the joy were
too great for one messenger to bring from Heaven, a multitude of voices broke forth in the anthem which all the nations of the saved shall one day sing, “Glory to God in the
highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.”
Oh, what a lesson is this wonderful story of Bethlehem!
How it rebukes our unbelief, our pride and self-sufficiency.
How it warns us to beware, lest by our criminal indifference
we also fail to discern the signs of the times, and therefore
know not the day of our visitation. It is “unto them that look
for Him” that Christ is to “appear the second time without
sin unto salvation.” Hebrews 9:28.
Jesus sends His people a message of warning to prepare them for His coming. To the prophet John was made
known the closing work in the great plan of man’s redemption. He beheld an angel flying “in the midst of heaven,
having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell
on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue,
and people, saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give
glory to Him; for the hour of His Judgment is come; and
worship Him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and
the fountains of waters.” Revelation 14:6, 7.
The angel represented in prophecy as delivering this message, symbolizes a class of faithful men, who, obedient to
the promptings of God’s Spirit and the teachings of His word,
proclaim this warning to the inhabitants of earth. This message was not to be committed to the religious leaders of
the people. They had failed to preserve their connection
with God, and had refused the light from Heaven; therefore
they were not of the number described by the apostle Paul:
“But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should
overtake you as a thief. Ye are all the children of light, and
the children of the day; we are not of the night nor of darkness.” 1 Thessalonians 5:4, 5.
The watchmen upon the walls of Zion should be the first
to catch the tidings of the Saviour’s advent, the first to lift
their voices to proclaim Him near, the first to warn the people

God

Honors

the

Humble

[314-316]

173

to prepare for His coming. But they were at ease, dreaming
of peace and safety, while the people were asleep in their
sins. Jesus saw His church, like the barren fig-tree, covered
with pretentious leaves, yet destitute of precious fruit. There
was a boastful observance of the forms of religion, while the
spirit of true humility, penitence and faith—which alone could
render the service acceptable to God—was lacking. Instead
of the graces of the Spirit, there were manifested pride, formalism, vainglory, selfishness, oppression. A backsliding
church closed their eyes to the signs of the times. God did
not forsake them, or suffer His faithfulness to fail; but they
departed from Him, and separated themselves from His love.
As they refused to comply with the conditions, His promises
were not fulfilled to them.
Love for Christ and faith in His coming waxed cold. Such
is the sure result of neglect to appreciate and improve the
light and privileges which God bestows. Unless the church
will follow on in His opening providence, accepting every ray of light, performing every duty which may be
revealed, religion will inevitably degenerate into the observance of forms, and the spirit of vital godliness will
disappear. This truth has been repeatedly illustrated in the
history of the church. God requires of His people works of
faith and obedience corresponding to the blessings and privileges bestowed. Obedience requires a sacrifice and involves
a cross; and this is why so many of the professed followers
of Christ refused to receive the light from Heaven, and, like
the Jews of old, knew not the time of their visitation. Luke
19:44. Because of their pride and unbelief, the Lord
passed them by, and revealed His truth to men in humble
life, who had given heed to all the light they had received.

Opening
the Prophecies

— William Miller

———————————————————————

What happens when people dedicate their lives to God—and
then open the Bible and begin studying it carefully—for years?
There is strength in the Word of God. And there is a wealth of
knowledge in its prophecies. The open Bible is the basis of most
powerful
power
ful revivals—revivals that change men’s lives —

———————————————————————

An upright, honest-hearted farmer, who had been led
to doubt the divine authority of the Scriptures, yet who
sincerely desired to know the truth, was the man chosen
of God to proclaim the nearness of Christ’s second coming. Like many other reformers, William Miller had in early
life battled with poverty, and had thus learned the great lessons of energy and self-denial. His mind was active and welldeveloped, and he had a keen thirst for knowledge. Though
he had not enjoyed the advantages of a collegiate education,
his love of study and a habit of careful thought and close
criticism rendered him a man of sound judgment and comprehensive views.
He possessed an irreproachable moral character and an
enviable reputation, being generally esteemed for his integrity, thrift, and benevolence. In childhood he had been subject to religious impressions; but in early manhood, being
thrown almost exclusively into the society of deists, he was
led to adopt their sentiments, which he continued to hold for
about twelve years. At the age of thirty-four, however, the
Holy Spirit impressed his heart with a sense of his condition as a sinner. He found in his former belief no assurance of happiness beyond the grave. The future was dark

William

Miller

[317-319]

175

and gloomy. Referring afterward to his feelings at this time,
he said:
“Annihilation was a cold and chilling thought, and accountability was sure destruction to all. The heavens were as
brass over my head, and the earth as iron under my feet.
Eternity—what was it? And death—why was it? The more I
reasoned, the further I was from demonstration. The more I
thought, the more scattered were my conclusions. I tried to
stop thinking; but my thoughts would not be controlled. I
was truly wretched, but did not understand the cause. I murmured and complained, but knew not of whom. I knew that
there was a wrong, but knew not where or how to find the
right. I mourned, but without hope.”
In this state he continued for some months. “Suddenly,”
he says, “the character of a Saviour was vividly impressed
upon my mind. It seemed that there might be a being so good
and compassionate as to Himself atone for our transgressions, and thereby save us from suffering the penalty of sin.
I immediately felt how lovely such a being must be, and imagined that I could cast myself into the arms of, and trust in the
mercy of, such a One. But the question arose, How can it be
proved that such a being does exist? Aside from the Bible, I
found that I could get no evidence of the existence of such a
Saviour, or even of a future state.”
“I saw that the Bible did bring to view just such a Saviour
as I needed; and I was perplexed to find how an uninspired
book should develop principles so perfectly adapted to the
wants of a fallen world. I was constrained to admit that
the Scriptures must be a revelation from God. They became my delight; and in Jesus I found a friend. The Saviour became to me the chiefest among ten thousand; and the
Scriptures, which before were dark and contradictory, now
became a lamp to my feet and a light to my path. My mind
became settled and satisfied. I found the Lord God to be a
Rock in the midst of the ocean of life. The Bible now became my chief study, and I can truly say, I searched it with
great delight. I found the half was never told me. I wondered
why I had not seen its beauty and glory before, and marveled

176

The

Great

Controversy

that I could ever have rejected it. I found everything revealed
that my heart could desire, and a remedy for every disease of
the soul. I lost all taste for other reading, and applied my
heart to get wisdom from God.”
He now publicly professed his faith in the religion
which he had despised. But his infidel associates were not
slow to bring forward all those arguments which he himself
had often urged against the divine authority of the Scriptures. He was not then prepared to answer them; but he reasoned, that if the Bible is a revelation from God, it must be
consistent with itself; and that as it was given for man’s instruction, it must be adapted to his understanding. He determined to study the Scriptures for himself, and ascertain if
every apparent contradiction could not be harmonized.
Endeavoring to lay aside all preconceived opinions,
and dispensing with commentaries, he compared scripture with scripture by the aid of the marginal references
and the concordance. He pursued his study in a regular
and methodical manner; beginning with Genesis, and reading verse by verse, he proceeded no faster than the meaning
of the several passages so unfolded as to leave him free from
all embarrassment. When he found anything obscure, it was
his custom to compare it with every other text which seemed
to have any reference to the matter under consideration. Every word was permitted to have its proper bearing upon the
subject of the text, and if his view of it harmonized with
every collateral passage, it ceased to be a difficulty. Thus
whenever he met with a passage hard to be understood,
he found an explanation in some other portion of the
Scriptures. As he studied with earnest prayer for divine enlightenment, that which had before appeared dark to his understanding was made clear. He experienced the truth of the
psalmist’s words, “The entrance of Thy words giveth light;
it giveth understanding unto the simple.” Psalm 119:130.
After two years of careful investigation, he was fully
satisfied, that the Bible is its own interpreter; that it is a
system of revealed truths so clearly and simply given that
the wayfaring man, though a fool, need not err therein; that

William

Miller

[319-330]

177

“all Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction
in righteousness;” (2 Timothy 3:16) that “prophecy came
not in old time by the will of man; but holy men of God
spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost;” (2 Peter 1:21)
that it was written “for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the Scriptures might have hope.” Romans 15:4.
With intense interest he studied the books of Daniel
and the Revelation, employing the same principles of interpretation as in the other scriptures, and found, to his great
joy, that the prophetic symbols could be understood. Angels
of Heaven were guiding his mind, and opening to his understanding prophecies which had ever been dark to God’s
people. Link after link of the chain of truth rewarded his
efforts; step by step he traced down the great lines of
prophecy, until he reached the solemn conclusion that in
a few years the Son of God would come the second time,
in power and glory, and that the events connected with that
coming and the close of human probation would take
place about the year 1843.
Deeply impressed by these momentous truths, he felt that
it was his duty to give the warning to the world. He expected
to encounter opposition from the ungodly, but was confident
that all Christians would rejoice in the hope of meeting the
Saviour whom they professed to love. His only fear was,
that in their great joy at the prospect of glorious deliverance,
so soon to be consummated, many would receive the doctrine without sufficiently examining the Scriptures in demonstration of its truth. He therefore hesitated to present it,
lest he should be in error, and be the means of misleading
others. He was thus led to review the evidences in support of
the conclusions at which he had arrived, and to consider carefully every difficulty which presented itself to his mind. He
found that objections vanished before the light of God’s word,
as mist before the rays of the sun. Five years spent thus,
left him fully convinced of the correctness of his position.

The

Great

Controversy

And now the duty of making known to others what he
believed to be so clearly taught in the Scriptures, urged
itself with new force upon him. “When I was about my
business,” he said, “it was continually ringing in my ears,
Go and tell the world of their danger. This text was constantly occurring to me: ‘When I say unto the wicked, O
wicked man, thou shalt surely die; if thou dost not speak to
warn the wicked from his way, that wicked man shall die in
his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine hand. Nevertheless, if thou warn the wicked of his way to turn from it;
if he do not turn from his way, he shall die in his iniquity; but
thou hast delivered thy soul.’ Ezekiel 33:8, 9. I felt that if
the wicked could be effectually warned, multitudes of them
would repent; and that if they were not warned, their blood
might be required at my hand.”
He began to present his views in private as he had opportunity, praying that some minister might feel their force and
devote himself to their promulgation. But he could not banish the conviction that he had a personal duty to perform in
giving the warning. The words were ever recurring to his
mind, “Go and tell it to the world; their blood will I require at thy hand.” For nine years he waited, the burden still
pressing upon his soul, until in 1831 he for the first time
publicly gave the reasons of his faith.
As Elisha was called from following his oxen in the field,
to receive the mantle of consecration to the prophetic office,
so was Wm. Miller called to leave his plow, and open to the
people the mysteries of the kingdom of God. With trembling he entered upon his work, leading his hearers down,
step by step, through the prophetic periods to the second appearing of Christ. With every effort he gained
strength and courage as he saw the wide-spread interest excited by his words.
Though he had little of the learning of the schools, he
became wise because he connected himself with the Source
of wisdom. He possessed strong mental powers, united with
true kindness of heart, Christian humility, calmness, and selfcontrol. He was a man of sterling worth, who could not but

William

Miller

[330-338]

179

command respect and esteem wherever integrity of character and moral excellence were valued. He was attentive and
affable to all, ready to listen to the opinions of others, and to
weigh their arguments. Without passion or excitement he
tested all theories and doctrines by the word of God;
and his sound reasoning, and intimate knowledge of the
Scriptures, enabled him to refute error and expose falsehood.
The Lord, in His great mercy, does not bring judgments upon the earth without giving warning to its inhabitants by the mouth of His servants. Says the prophet
Amos, “Surely the Lord God will do nothing, but He revealeth
His secret unto His servants the prophets.” Amos 3:7. When
the iniquity of the antediluvians moved Him to bring a
flood of waters upon the earth, He first made known to
them His purpose, that they might have opportunity to
turn from their evil ways. For a hundred and twenty years
was sounded in their ears the warning to repent, lest the wrath
of God be manifested in their destruction. But the message
seemed to them an idle tale, and they believed it not. From
unbelief they proceeded to scorn and contempt, ridiculing
the warning as highly improbable, and unworthy of their notice. Emboldened in their wickedness, they mocked the messenger of God, made light of his entreaties, and even accused him of presumption. How dare one man stand up
against all the great men of the earth? If Noah’s message
were true, why did not all the world see it and believe it?
One man’s assertion against the wisdom of thousands! They
would not credit the warning, nor would they seek shelter in
the ark.
Scoffers pointed to the things of nature,—to the unvarying succession of the seasons, to the blue skies that had never
poured out rain, to the green fields refreshed by the soft dews
of night,—and they cried out, “Doth he not speak parables?”
In contempt they declared the preacher of righteousness to
be a wild enthusiast; and they went on, more eager in their
pursuit of pleasure, more intent upon their evil ways, than
ever before. But their unbelief did not hinder the predicted

180

The

Great

Controversy

event. God bore long with their wickedness, giving them
ample opportunity for repentance; but at the appointed time
His judgments were visited upon the rejecters of His mercy.
Christ declares that there will exist similar unbelief
concerning His second coming. As the people of Noah’s
day “knew not until the flood came and took them all away,
so,” in the words of our Saviour, “shall also the coming of
the Son of man be.” Matthew 24:39. When the professed
people of God are uniting with the world, living as they live,
and joining with them in forbidden pleasure; when the luxury
of the world becomes the luxury of the church; when the
marriage bells are chiming, and all are looking forward to
many years of worldly prosperity,—then, suddenly as the
lightning flashes from the heavens, will come the end of their
bright visions and delusive hopes.
As God sent His servant to warn the world of the coming
flood, so He sent chosen messengers to make known the nearness of the day of final judgment. But as Noah’s contemporaries laughed to scorn the predictions of the solitary
preacher of righteousness, so did many in Miller’s day
treat his words of warning.
In their labors for the Protestant churches, Wm. Miller
and his companions encountered a spirit of hatred and opposition little less bitter than that which Luther experienced
from Rome. By Romanists in Luther’s time, and by Protestants in the time of Miller, fables, false theories, human forms
and customs, were received and honored in place of the teachings of the word of truth. In the sixteenth century the Roman
Church withheld the Scriptures from the people; in the nineteenth century, when Bibles are scattered everywhere like
leaves of autumn, the Protestant churches teach that an important part of the sacred word—and that portion which
brings to view truths especially applicable to our time—is
sealed, and cannot be understood.
Ministers and people have declared the prophecies of
Daniel and John to be a collection of mysteries which no
one could understand or explain. But the very title of the
book of Revelation contradicts these assertions: “The

William Miller

[338-342]

181

Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him, to
show unto His servants things which must shortly come to
pass; and He sent and signified it by His angel unto His servant John, who bare record of the word of God, and of the
testimony of Jesus Christ, and of all things that he saw.
Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of
this prophecy, and keep those things which are written therein;
for the time is at hand.” Revelation 1:1-3.
Says the prophet, “Blessed is he that readeth”—there
are some who will not read; the blessing is not for them.
“And they that hear”—there are some, also, who refuse to
hear anything concerning the prophecies; the blessing is not
for this class. “And keep those things that are written
therein”—many refuse to heed the warnings and instructions
contained in the Revelation. None of these can claim the
blessing promised. All who ridicule the subjects of the prophecy, and mock at the symbols here solemnly given, all who
refuse to reform their lives, and prepare for the coming of
the Son of man, will be unblest.
In view of the testimony of Inspiration, how dare ministers teach that the Revelation is a mystery beyond the reach
of human understanding? It is a mystery revealed, a book
opened. The study of the Revelation directs the mind to
the prophecies of Daniel, and both present most important instruction, given of God to men, concerning events
to take place at the close of this world’s history.
To John were opened scenes of deep and thrilling interest
in the experience of the church. He saw the position, dangers, conflicts, and final deliverance of the people of God.
He records the closing messages which are to ripen the harvest of the earth, either as sheaves for the heavenly garner or
as fagots for the fires of the last day. Subjects of vast importance were revealed to him especially for the last church,
that those who should turn from error to truth might be instructed concerning the perils and conflicts before them. None
need be in darkness in regard to what is coming upon the
earth.
Why, then, this wide-spread ignorance concerning an

182

The

Great

Controversy

important part of Holy Writ? Why this general reluctance
to investigate its teachings? It is the result of a studied effort
of the prince of darkness to conceal from men that which
reveals his deceptions. For this reason, Christ the Revelator,
foreseeing the warfare that would be waged against the study
of the Revelation, pronounced a blessing upon all who should
read, hear, and observe the words of the prophecy.
Those who believed that the Advent movement was
of God, went forth as did Luther and his co-laborers,
with their Bibles in their hands, and with fearless firmness met the opposition of the world’s great teachers.
Many to whom the people had looked for instruction in divine things were proved to be ignorant both of the Scriptures and of the power of God. Yet their very ignorance rendered them more determined; they could not maintain their
position by the Scriptures, and they were driven to resort to
the sayings and doctrines of men, to the traditions of the
Fathers.
But the word of God was the only testimony accepted
by the advocates of truth. “The Bible and the Bible only,”
was their watchword. The weakness of all arguments brought
against them, revealed to Adventists the strength of the foundation upon which they stood. At the same time it angered
their opponents, who, for want of stronger weapons, resorted
to personal abuse. Grave doctors of divinity sneered at Wm.
Miller as an unlearned and feeble adversary. Because he explained the visions of Daniel and John, he was denounced as
a man of fanciful ideas, who made visions and dreams his
hobby. The plainest statements of Bible facts, which could
not be controverted, were met with the cry of heresy, ignorance, stupidity, insolence.
Many churches were thrown open to the enemies of
the Advent faith, while they were closed against its
friends. The sentiments expressed by Doctor Eck concerning Luther were the same that inspired ministers and people
to refuse Adventists a hearing. Said the papal champion: “I
am surprised at the humility and modesty with which the
reverend doctor [Luther] undertakes to oppose, alone, so

William Miller

[342, --]

183

many illustrious Fathers, thus affirming that he knows more
of these things than the sovereign pontiffs, the councils, the
doctors, and the universities.” “It would be surprising, no
doubt, if God had hidden the truth from so many saints and
martyrs until the advent of the reverend father.” Thus thought
great and wise men in the days of Noah, thus argued the
opponents of Wm. Miller, and thus still argue those who
oppose the proclamation of the Advent faith and the commandments of God.
When Luther was accused of preaching novelties, he declared: “These are not novelties that I preach. But I affirm
that the doctrines of Christianity have been lost sight of by
those whose special duty it was to preserve them; by the
learned, by the bishops. I doubt not indeed that the truth has
still found an abode in some few hearts.” “Poor husbandmen and simple children in these days understand more of
Jesus Christ than the pope, the bishops, or the doctors.” When
Wm. Miller was charged with showing contempt for the doctors of divinity, he pointed to the word of God as the standard by which all doctrines and theories must be tested;
and, knowing that he had truth on his side, he went forward in his work undismayed.
In every age, God has called His servants to lift up
their voices against the prevailing errors and sins of the
multitude. Noah was called to stand alone to warn the antediluvian world. Moses and Aaron were alone against king
and princes, magicians and wise men, and the multitudes of
Egypt. Elijah was alone when he testified against an apostate king and a backsliding people. Daniel and his fellows
stood alone against the decrees of mighty monarchs. The
majority are usually to be found on the side of error and
falsehood. The fact that doctors of divinity have the world
on their side does not prove them to be on the side of truth
and of God. The wide gate and the broad road attract the
multitudes, while the strait gate and the narrow way are
sought only by the few.
If ministers and people had really desired to know the
truth, and had given to the Advent doctrine the earnest,

184

The

Great

Controversy

prayerful attention which its importance demands, they
would have seen that it was in harmony with the Scriptures. Had they united with its advocates in their labors, there
would have resulted such a revival of the work of God as the
world has never witnessed. As Whitefield and the Wesleys
were urged by the Holy Spirit to arouse the formal and worldloving churches of their time, so was Wm. Miller moved to
proclaim the coming of Christ and the necessity of a work of
preparation. His only offense was that of opening to the world
the “sure word of prophecy, whereunto,” says the apostle
Peter, “ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth
in a dark place.” 2 Peter 1:19. He urged its truths upon the
people, not with harshness, but in a more mild and persuasive manner than was employed by other reformers.
The opposition which he encountered was very similar to
that which had been experienced by Wesley and his fellowlaborers. Let the popular churches of to-day remember that
the men whose memory they cherish with reverence endured
the same hatred, scorn, and abuse from the press and the
pulpit that were heaped upon Wm. Miller.
Why were the doctrine and preaching of Christ’s second coming so offensive to the churches? When Jesus made
known to His disciples that He must be separated from them,
he said, “I go to prepare a place for you; and if I go and
prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you
unto Myself, that where I am, there ye may be also.” John
14:2, 3. When He ascended from Olivet, the compassionate
Saviour, anticipating the loneliness and sorrow of His followers, commissioned angels to comfort them with the assurance that He would come again in person, even as He
went into heaven. As the disciples stood gazing intently upward to catch the last glimpse of Him whom they loved, their
attention was arrested by the words, “Ye men of Galilee,
why stand ye gazing up into heaven? This same Jesus which
is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen Him go into heaven.” Acts 1:11. Hope
was kindled afresh by the angels’ message. The disciples
“returned to Jerusalem with great joy, and were continually

William Miller [ -- ]

185

in the temple, praising and blessing God.” Luke 24:52, 53.
They were not rejoicing because Jesus had been separated
from them and they were left to struggle with the trials and
temptations of the world, but because of the angels’ assurance that He would come again.
Those who really love the Saviour cannot but hail with
joy a message founded upon the word of God, that He in
whom their hopes of eternal life are centered is coming
again, not to be insulted, despised, and rejected, as at His
first advent, but in power and glory, to redeem His people.
The proclamation of Christ’s coming should now be, as when
made by the angels to the shepherds of Bethlehem, good tidings of great joy. There can be no more conclusive evidence
that the churches have departed from God than the irritation
and animosity excited by this Heaven-sent message.
It is those who do not love the Saviour that desire Him
to remain away, and such eagerly receive the testimony
borne by unfaithful servants, “My Lord delayeth His coming.” Matthew 24:48. While they refuse to search the Scriptures to learn if these things are so, they grasp every fable
which will put off the coming of Christ into the distant future, or make it spiritual, fulfilled at the destruction of Jerusalem, or taking place at death.
Again and again did Wm. Miller urge that if his doctrine
were false, he should be shown his error from the Scriptures.
In an address to Christians of all denominations he wrote:
“What have we believed that we have not been commanded to believe by the word of God, which you yourselves allow is the rule and the only rule of our faith and
practice? What have we done that should call down such
virulent denunciations against us from pulpit and press, and
give you just cause to exclude us (Adventists) from your
churches and fellowship?” “If we are wrong, pray show us
wherein consists our wrong. Show us from the word of
God that we are in error; we have had ridicule enough;
that can never convince us that we are in the wrong; the word
of God alone can change our views. Our conclusions have

186

The

Great

Controversy

been formed deliberately and prayerfully, as we have seen
the evidence in the Scriptures.”
At a later date he stated: “I have candidly weighed the
objections advanced against these views; but I have seen no
arguments that were sustained by the Scriptures that, in my
opinion, invalidated my position. I cannot, therefore, conscientiously refrain from looking for my Lord, or from
exhorting my fellow-men, as I have opportunity, to be in
readiness for that event.”
In a letter to a friend and fellow-laborer, he spoke thus: “I
could not see that I should harm my fellowmen, even supposing the event should not take place at the time specified;
for it is a command of our Saviour to look for it, watch,
expect it, and be ready. Then, if I could by any means, in
accordance with God’s word, persuade men to believe in a
crucified, risen, and coming Saviour, I felt it would have a
bearing on the everlasting welfare and happiness of such. I
had not a distant thought of disturbing our churches, ministers, religious editors, or departing from the best biblical commentaries or rules which had been recommended for the study
of the Scriptures. And even to this day, my opposers have
not been able to show where I have departed from any rule
laid down by our old standard writers of the Protestant faith.
I have only interpreted Scripture in accordance with their
rules.”
Instead of arguments from the Scriptures, the opponents of the Advent faith chose to employ ridicule and
scoffing. The careless and ungodly, emboldened by the position of religious teachers, resorted to opprobrious epithets,
to base and blasphemous witticisms, in their efforts to heap
contumely upon Wm. Miller and his work. The gray-headed
man who had left a comfortable home to travel at his own
expense from city to city, from town to village, toiling unceasingly to bear to the world the solemn warning of the
Judgment near, was sneeringly denounced as a fanatic, a liar,
a speculating knave.
Time, means, and talents were employed in misrepresent-

William Miller [ -- ]

187

ing and maligning Adventists, in exciting prejudice against
them, and holding them up to public contempt. Ministers
occupied themselves in gathering up damaging reports, absurd and malicious fabrications, and dealing them out from
the pulpit. Earnest were the efforts put forth to draw away
the minds of the people from the subject of the second
advent. But in seeking to crush out Adventism, the popular
ministry undermined faith in the word of God. It was made
to appear a sin, something of which men should be ashamed,
to study the prophecies which relate to the coming of Christ
and the end of the world. This teaching made men infidels,
and many took license to walk after their own ungodly lusts.
Then the authors of the evil charged it all upon Adventists.
The Wesleys encountered similar accusations from the
ease-loving, godless ministers who were constantly intercepting their labors, and seeking to destroy their influence. They were pronounced uncharitable, and accused
of pride and vanity, because they did not pay homage to the
popular teachers of their time. They were accused of skepticism, of disorderly practices, and of contempt of authority.
John Wesley fearlessly threw back these charges upon those
who framed them, showing that they themselves were responsible for the very evils of which they accused the Methodists. In a similar manner may the charges against Adventism be refuted.
The great controversy between truth and error has
been carried forward from century to century since the
fall of man. God and angels, and those united with them,
have been inviting, urging men to repentance and holiness and Heaven; while Satan and his angels, and men inspired by them, have been opposing every effort to benefit
and save the fallen race. Wm. Miller was disturbing Satan’s
kingdom, and the arch-enemy sought not only to counteract
the effect of the message, but to destroy the messenger himself. As Wm. Miller made a practical application of Scripture truth to the hearts of his hearers, the rage of professed
Christians was kindled against him, even as the anger of the

188

The

Great

Controversy

Jews was excited against Christ and His apostles. Churchmembers stirred up the baser classes, and upon several occasions enemies plotted to take his life as he should leave
the place of meeting. But holy angels were in the throng, and
one of these, in the form of a man, took the arm of this servant of the Lord, and led him in safety from the angry mob.
His work was not yet done, and Satan and his emissaries
were disappointed in their purpose.
Comparing his own expectations as to the effect of his
preaching with the manner in which it had been received by
the religious world, Wm. Miller said: “It is true, but not wonderful, when we become acquainted with the state and corruption of the present age, . . . that I have met with great
opposition from the pulpit and professed religious press; and
I have been instrumental, through the preaching of the Advent doctrine, of making it quite manifest that not a few of
our theological teachers are infidels in disguise. I cannot for
a moment believe that denying the resurrection of the body,
or the return of Christ to this earth, or a judgment day yet
future, is any the less infidelity now than it was in the days
of infidel France; and yet who does not know that these things
are as common as pulpits and presses are? And which of
these questions are not publicly denied in our pulpits, and by
the writers and editors of the public papers?
“Surely, we have fallen on strange times. I expected of
course the doctrine of Christ’s speedy coming would be opposed by infidels, blasphemers, drunkards, gamblers, and
the like; but I did not expect that ministers of the gospel and
professors of religion would unite with characters of the
above description, at stores and public places, in ridiculing
the solemn doctrine of the second advent. Many who were
not professors of religion have affirmed to me these facts,
and say they have seen them and have felt their blood chilled
at the sight.
“These are some of the effects which are produced by
preaching this solemn and soul-stirring doctrine among our
Pharisees of the present day. Is it possible that such minis-

William Miller [ -- ]

189

ters and members are obeying God, and watching and praying for His glorious appearing, while they join these scoffers
in their unholy and ungodly remarks? If Christ does come,
where must they appear? and what a dreadful account they
will meet in that tremendous hour!”
It is the lot of God’s servants to suffer opposition and
reproach from their contemporaries. Now, as in the time
of our Saviour, men build the sepulchers and sound the
praises of the dead prophets, while they persecute the
living messengers of the Most High. Wm. Miller was despised and hated by the ungodly and unbelieving; but his
influence and his labors were a blessing to the world. Under
his preaching, thousands of sinners were converted, backsliders were reclaimed, and multitudes were led to study the
Scriptures and to find in them a beauty and glory before unknown.

The prophecy of the first angel’s message, brought to
view in Revelation 14, found its fulfillment in the Advent
movement of 1840-1844. In both Europe and America, men
of faith and prayer were deeply moved as their attention was
called to the prophecies, and, tracing down the inspired
record, they saw convincing evidence that the end of all things
was at hand. The Spirit of God urged His servants, to give
the warning. Far and wide spread the message of the everlasting gospel, “Fear God, and give glory to Him; for the
hour of His Judgment is come.” Revelation 14:7.
Wherever missionaries had penetrated, were sent the
glad tidings of Christ’s speedy return. In different lands
were found isolated bodies of Christians, who, solely by the
study of the Scriptures, had arrived at the belief that the
Saviour’s advent was near. In some portions of Europe, where
the laws were so oppressive as to forbid the preaching of the
Advent doctrine, little children were impelled to declare it,
and many listened to the solemn warning.
To Wm. Miller and his co-laborers it was given to
preach the message in America, and the light kindled by
their labors shone out to distant lands. The testimony of
the Scriptures pointing to the coming of Christ in 1843, awak-

The

First

Angel’s

Message

[355-369]

ened wide-spread interest. Many were convinced that the arguments from the prophetic periods were correct, and, sacrificing their pride of opinion, they joyfully received the truth.
Some ministers laid aside their sectarian views and feelings,
left their salaries and their churches, and united in proclaiming the coming of Jesus. There were but few ministers,
however, who would accept this message; therefore it was
largely committed to humble laymen. Farmers left their
fields, mechanics their tools, traders their merchandise, professional men their positions; and yet the number of workers
was small in comparison with the work to be accomplished.
The condition of an ungodly church and a world lying in
wickedness burdened the souls of the true watchmen, and
they willingly endured toil, privation, and suffering that they
might call men to repentance unto salvation. Though opposed by Satan, the work went steadily forward, and the
Advent truth was accepted by many thousands.
Everywhere was heard the searching testimony warning sinners, both worldlings and church-members, to flee
from the wrath to come. Like John the Baptist, the forerunner of Christ, the preachers laid the ax at the root of the
tree, and urged all to bring forth fruit meet for repentance.
Their stirring appeals were in marked contrast to the assurances of peace and safety that were heard from popular pulpits; and wherever the message was given, it moved the
people. The simple, direct testimony of the Scriptures, set
home by the power of the Holy Spirit, brought a weight of
conviction which few were able wholly to resist. Professors
of religion were roused from their false security. They saw
their backslidings, their worldliness and unbelief, their pride
and selfishness. Many sought the Lord with repentance and
humiliation. The affections that had so long clung to earthly
things they now fixed upon Heaven. The Spirit of God rested
upon them, and with hearts softened and subdued they joined
to sound the cry, “Fear God, and give glory to Him; for the
hour of His Judgment is come.”
Sinners inquired with weeping, “What must I do to
be saved?” Those whose lives had been marked with dis-

honesty were anxious to make restitution. All who found
peace in Christ longed to see others share the blessing. The
hearts of parents were turned to their children, and the hearts
of children to their parents. The barriers of pride and reserve
were swept away. Heartfelt confessions were made, and the
members of the household labored for the salvation of those
who were nearest and dearest. Often was heard the sound of
earnest intercession. Everywhere were souls in deep anguish,
pleading with God. Many wrestled all night in prayer for the
assurance that their own sins were pardoned, or for the conversion of their relatives or neighbors. That earnest, determined faith gained its object. Had the people of God continued to be thus importunate in prayer, pressing their petitions
at the mercy-seat, they would be in possession of a far richer
experience than they now have. There is too little prayer, too
little real conviction of sin; and the lack of living faith leaves
many destitute of the grace so richly provided by our gracious Redeemer.
All classes flocked to the Adventist meetings. Rich and
poor, high and low, were, from various causes, anxious
to hear for themselves the doctrine of the second advent.
The Lord held the spirit of opposition in check while His
servants explained the reasons of their faith. Sometimes the
instrument was feeble; but the Spirit of God gave power to
His truth. The presence of holy angels was felt in these assemblies, and many were daily added to the believers. As the
evidences of Christ’s soon coming were repeated, vast crowds
listened in breathless silence to the solemn words. Heaven
and earth seemed to approach each other. The power of God
would be felt upon old and young and middle-aged. Men
sought their homes with praises upon their lips, and the glad
sound rang out upon the still night air. None who attended
those meetings can ever forget those scenes of deepest interest.
The proclamation of a definite time for Christ’s coming called forth great opposition from many of all classes,
from the minister in the pulpit down to the most reckless, Heaven-daring sinner. “No man knoweth the day nor

the hour!” was heard alike from the hypocritical minister
and the bold scoffer. They closed their ears to the clear and
harmonious explanation of the text by those who were pointing to the close of the prophetic periods and to the signs
which Christ Himself had foretold as tokens of His advent.
Many who professed to love the Saviour, declared that they
had no opposition to the preaching of His coming; they merely
objected to the definite time. God’s all-seeing eye read their
hearts. They did not wish to hear of Christ’s coming to judge
the world in righteousness. They had been unfaithful servants, their works would not bear the inspection of the heartsearching God, and they feared to meet their Lord. Like the
Jews at the time of Christ’s first advent, they were not prepared to welcome Jesus. Satan and his angels exulted and
flung the taunt in the face of Christ and holy angels, that His
professed people had so little love for Him that they did not
desire His appearing.
Unfaithful watchmen hindered the progress of the
work of God. As the people were roused, and began to
inquire the way of salvation, these leaders stepped in
between them and the truth, seeking to quiet their fears
by falsely interpreting the word of God. In this work, Satan and unconsecrated ministers united, crying, Peace, peace,
when God had not spoken peace. Like the Pharisees in
Christ’s day, many refused to enter the kingdom of Heaven
themselves, and those who were entering in, they hindered.
The blood of these souls will be required at their hand.
Wherever the message of truth was proclaimed, the
most humble and devoted in the churches were the first
to receive it. Those who studied the Bible for themselves
could not but see the unscriptural character of the popular
views of prophecy, and wherever the people were not deceived by the efforts of the clergy to misstate and pervert the
faith, wherever they would search the word of God for themselves, the Advent doctrine needed only to be compared with
the Scriptures to establish its divine authority.
Many were persecuted by their unbelieving brethren.
In order to retain their position in the church, some con-

194

sented to be silent in regard to their hope; but others felt
that loyalty to God forbade them thus to hide the truths
which He had committed to their trust. Not a few were
cut off from the fellowship of the church for no other reason
than expressing their belief in the coming of Christ. Very
precious to those who bore the trial of their faith were the
words of the prophet, “Your brethren that hated you, that
cast you out for My name’s sake, said, Let the Lord be glorified. But He shall appear to your joy, and they shall be
ashamed.” Isaiah 66:5.
Angels of God were watching with the deepest interest the result of the warning. When the churches as a body
rejected the message, angels turned away from them in sadness. Yet there were in the churches many who had not yet
been tested in regard to the Advent truth. Many were deceived by husbands, wives, parents, or children, and were
made to believe it a sin even to listen to such heresies as
were taught by the Adventists. Angels were bidden to keep
faithful watch over these souls; for another light was yet to
shine upon them from the throne of God.
With unspeakable desire those who had received the
message watched for the coming of their Saviour. The
time when they expected to meet Him was at hand. They
approached this hour with a calm solemnity. They rested in
sweet communion with God, an earnest of the peace that
was to be theirs in the bright hereafter. None who experienced this hope and trust can forget those precious hours of
waiting. Worldly business was for the most part laid aside
for a few weeks. Believers carefully examined every thought
and emotion of their hearts as if upon their death-beds and
in a few hours to close their eyes upon earthly scenes. There
was no making of “ascension robes;” but all felt the need of
internal evidence that they were prepared to meet the Saviour; their white robes were purity of soul,—characters
cleansed from sin by the atoning blood of Christ.
God designed to prove His people. His hand covered
a mistake in the reckoning of the prophetic periods. Adventists did not discover the error, nor was it discovered

The

Message

[372-374]

195

by the most learned of their opponents. The latter said,
“Your reckoning of the prophetic periods is correct. Some
great event is about to take place; but it is not what Mr. Miller
predicts; it is the conversion of the world, and not the second
advent of Christ.”
The time of expectation passed, and Christ did not
appear for the deliverance of His people. Those who with
sincere faith and love had looked for their Saviour, experienced a bitter disappointment. Yet the Lord had accomplished His purpose: He had tested the hearts of those
who professed to be waiting for His appearing. There were
among them many who had been actuated by no higher motive than fear. Their profession of faith had not affected their
hearts or their lives. When the expected event failed to take
place, these persons declared that they were not disappointed;
they had never believed that Christ would come. They were
among the first to ridicule the sorrow of the true believers.
But Jesus and all the heavenly host looked with love and
sympathy upon the tried and faithful yet disappointed ones.
Could the vail separating the visible from the invisible world
have been swept back, angels would have been seen drawing near to these steadfast souls, and shielding them from
the shafts of Satan.

The churches that refused to receive the first angel’s
message, rejected light from Heaven. That message was
sent in mercy to arouse them to see their true condition
of worldliness and backsliding, and to seek a preparation to meet their Lord. God has ever required His people
to remain separate from the world, that they might not be
allured from their allegiance to Him. He delivered the Israelites from bondage in Egypt because He would not have them
corrupted by the idolatry with which they were there surrounded. The children of this world are the children of darkness. Their attention is not directed to the Sun of Righteousness, but is centered upon themselves and the treasures of
earth. Blinded by the god of this world, they have no just
perception of the glory and majesty of the true God. While
they enjoy His gifts, they forget the claims of the Giver. Such
have chosen to walk in darkness, and they are led by the
prince of the powers of darkness. They do not love and enjoy divine things, because they do not discern their value or
loveliness. They have alienated themselves from the light of
God, and their understanding becomes so confused in regard to that which is right, true, and holy, that the things of
the Spirit of God are foolishness to them.

The

Second

Angel’s

Message

[380]

197

It was to separate the church of Christ from the corrupting influence of the world that the first angel’s message was given. But with the multitude, even of professed
Christians, the ties which bound them to earth were stronger
than the attractions heavenward. They chose to listen to the
voice of worldly wisdom, and turned away from the heartsearching message of truth.
Peter, writing as he was inspired by the Holy Spirit,
described the manner in which the message of Christ’s
second coming would be received: “There shall come in
the last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts, and saying, Where is the promise of His coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the
beginning of the creation. For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the word of God the heavens were of old, and
the earth standing out of the water and in the water; whereby
the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished; but the heavens and the earth which are now, by the
same word are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the
day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men.” 2 Peter 3:37.
Those who perished in the waters of the flood had an
opportunity to escape. All were urged to find refuge in
the ark; but the multitudes refused to heed the warning.
So when the first angel’s message was given, all who heard
were invited to receive it, and share the blessing to follow its
acceptance; but many scorned and rejected the call. One
turned to his farm, another to his merchandise, and they cared
for none of these things. Inspiration declares that when the
antediluvians rejected Noah’s words, the Spirit of God ceased
to strive with them. So when men now despise the warnings
which God in mercy sends them, His Spirit after a time ceases
to arouse conviction in their hearts. God gives light to be
cherished and obeyed, not to be despised and rejected. The
light which He sends becomes darkness to those who disregard it. When the Spirit of God ceases to impress the truth
upon the hearts of men, all hearing is vain, and all preaching
also is vain.

198

The

Great

Controversy

When the churches spurned the counsel of God by rejecting the Advent message, the Lord rejected them. The first
angel was followed by a second, proclaiming, “Babylon
is fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she made all
nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.” Revelation 14:8. This message was understood by
Adventists to be an announcement of the moral fall of the
churches in consequence of their rejection of the first message. The proclamation, “Babylon is fallen,” was given in
the summer of 1844, and as the result, about fifty thousand
withdrew from these churches.
The term Babylon, derived from Babel, and signifying confusion, is applied in Scripture to the various forms
of false or apostate religion. But the message announcing
the fall of Babylon must apply to some religious body that
was once pure, and has become corrupt. It cannot be the
Romish Church which is here meant; for that church has been
in a fallen condition for many centuries. But how appropriate the figure as applied to the Protestant churches, all professing to derive their doctrines from the Bible, yet divided
into almost innumerable sects. The unity for which Christ
prayed does not exist. Instead of one Lord, one faith, one
baptism, there are numberless conflicting creeds and theories. Religious faith appears so confused and discordant that
the world know not what to believe as truth. God is not all in
this; it is the work,—the work of Satan.
In Revelation 17, Babylon is represented as a woman,
a figure which is used in the Scriptures as the symbol of
a church. A virtuous woman represents a pure church, a
vile woman an apostate church. Babylon is said to be a harlot; and the prophet beheld her drunken with the blood of
saints and martyrs. The Babylon thus described represents
Rome, that apostate church which has so cruelly persecuted
the followers of Christ. But Babylon the harlot is the
mother of daughters who follow her example of corruption. Thus are represented those churches that cling to
the doctrines and traditions of Rome and follow her
worldly practices, and whose fall is announced in the sec-

The

Second

Angel’s

Message

[380-388]

199

ond angel’s message.
The close relation of the church to Christ is represented
under the figure of marriage. The Lord had joined His
people to Himself by a solemn covenant, He promising to be
their God, and they pledging themselves to be His, and His
alone. Said Paul, addressing the church, “I have espoused
you to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin
to Christ.” 2 Corinthians 11:2. But when her confidence and
affection were turned away from Him, and she sought after
vanity, and allowed the love of worldly things to separate
her from God, she forfeited the privileges included in this
peculiar and sacred relation. By the apostle James those who
assimilate to the world are addressed as “adulterers and adulteresses.” James 4:4.
A profession of religion has become popular with the
world. Rulers, politicians, lawyers, doctors, merchants, join
the church as a means of securing the respect and confidence
of society, and advancing their own worldly interests. Thus
they seek to cover all their unrighteous transactions under a
profession of Christianity. The various religious bodies, reenforced by the wealth and influence of these baptized worldlings, make a still higher bid for popularity and patronage.
Splendid churches, embellished in the most extravagant
manner, are erected on popular avenues. The worshipers array themselves in costly and fashionable attire. A high salary is paid for a talented minister to entertain and attract the
people. His sermons must not touch popular sins, but be made
smooth and pleasing for fashionable ears. Thus fashionable
sinners are enrolled on the church-records, and fashionable sins are concealed under a pretense of godliness.
God looks down upon these apostate bodies, and declares
them daughters of a harlot. To secure the favor and support
of the great men of earth, they have broken their solemn vows
of allegiance and fidelity to the King of Heaven.
The great sin charged against Babylon is, that she “made
all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.”
This cup of intoxication which she presents to the world,
represents the false doctrines which she has accepted as the

200

The

Great

Controversy

result of her unlawful connection with the great ones of the
earth. Friendship with the world corrupts her faith, and
in her turn she exerts a corrupting influence upon the
world by teaching doctrines which are opposed to the
plainest statements of the word of God.
Prominent among these false doctrines is that of the
temporal millennium,—a thousand years of spiritual
peace and prosperity, in which the world is to be converted, before the coming of Christ. This siren song has
lulled thousands of souls to sleep over the abyss of eternal
ruin.
The doctrine of the natural immortality of the soul
has opened the way for the artful working of Satan
through modern Spiritualism; and besides the Romish errors, purgatory, prayers for the dead, invocation of saints,
etc., which have sprung from this source, it has led many
Protestants to deny the resurrection and the Judgment, and
has given rise to the revolting heresy of eternal torment, and
the dangerous delusion of Universalism.
And even more dangerous and more widely held than
these are the assumptions that the law of God was abolished at the cross, and that the first day of the week is
now a holy day, instead of the Sabbath of the fourth commandment.
When faithful teachers expound the word of God, there
arise men of learning, ministers professing to understand the
Scriptures, who denounce sound doctrine as heresy, and thus
turn away inquirers after truth. Were it not that the world is
hopelessly intoxicated with the wine of Babylon, multitudes
would be convicted and converted by the plain, cutting truths
of the word of God. The sin of the world’s impenitence lies
at the door of the church.
God sent His professed people a message that would
have corrected the evils which separated them from His
favor. A state of union, faith, and love had been produced
among those who from every denomination in Christendom
received the Advent doctrine; and had the churches in general accepted the same truth, the same blessed results would

The

Second

Angel’s

Message

[388,

--]

201

have followed. But Babylon scornfully rejected the last means
which Heaven had in reserve for her restoration, and then,
with greater eagerness, she turned to seek the friendship of
the world.
Those who preached the first message had no purpose or expectation of causing divisions in the churches,
or of forming separate organizations. “In all my labors,”
said Wm. Miller, “I never had the desire or thought to establish any separate interest from that of existing denominations, or to benefit one at the expense of another. I thought to
benefit all. Supposing that all Christians would rejoice in
the prospect of Christ’s coming, and that those who could
not see as I did would not love any the less those who should
embrace this doctrine, I did not conceive there would ever be
any necessity for separate meetings. My whole object was a
desire to convert souls to God, to notify the world of a coming Judgment, and to induce my fellow-men to make that
preparation of heart which will enable them to meet their
God in peace. The great majority of those who were converted under my labors united with the various existing
churches. When individuals came to me to inquire respecting their duty, I always told them to go where they would
feel at home; and I never favored any one denomination in
my advice to such.”
For a time many of the churches welcomed his labors;
but as they decided against the Advent truth, they desired to suppress all agitation of the subject. Those who
had accepted the doctrine were thus placed in a position of
great trial and perplexity. They loved their churches, and were
loath to separate from them; but as they were ridiculed and
oppressed, denied the privilege of speaking of their hope, or
of attending preaching upon the Lord’s coming, many at last
arose and cast off the yoke which had been imposed upon
them.
In the days of the Reformation, the gentle and pious
Melancthon declared, “There is no other church than the assembly of those who have the word of God, and who are

202

The

Great

Controversy

purified by it.” Adventists, seeing that the churches rejected
the testimony of God’s word, could no longer regard them as
constituting the church of Christ, “the pillar and ground of
the truth;” and as the message, “Babylon is fallen,” began to
be proclaimed, they felt themselves justified in separating
from their former connection.
Since the rejection of the first message, a sad change
has taken place in the churches. As truth is spurned, error
is received and cherished. Love for God, and faith in His
word, have grown cold. The churches have grieved the Spirit
of the Lord, and it has been in a great measure withdrawn.
The words of the prophet Ezekiel are fearfully applicable:
“Son of man, these men have set up their idols in their heart,
and put the stumbling-block of their iniquity before their
face. Should I be inquired of at all by them?” “I the Lord will
answer him that cometh according to the multitude of his
idols.” Ezekiel 14:3, 4. Men may not bow down to idols of
wood and stone, but all who love the things of the world
and take pleasure in unrighteousness have set up idols in
their hearts. The majority of professed Christians are serving other gods besides the Lord. Pride and luxury are cherished, idols are set up in the sanctuary, and her holy places
are polluted.
Anciently the Lord declared to His servants concerning
Israel: “The leaders of this people cause them to err, and
they that are led of them are destroyed.” Isaiah 9:16. “The
prophets prophesy falsely, and the priests bear rule by their
means, and My people love to have it so; and what will ye do
in the end thereof?” Jeremiah 5:31. “For from the least of
them even unto the greatest of them, every one is given to
covetousness; and from the prophet even unto the priest,
every one dealeth falsely.” Jeremiah 6:13. The Jewish church,
once so highly favored of the Lord, became an astonishment
and a reproach through neglect to improve the blessings
granted them. Pride and unbelief led to their ruin. But these
scriptures do not apply to ancient Israel only. The character
and condition of many nominally Christian churches are here

The

Second

Angel’s

Message

[--,

389]

203

portrayed. Though in possession of far greater blessings than
were granted to the Jews, they are following in the steps of
that people; and the greater the light and privileges bestowed,
the greater the guilt of those who permit them to pass unimproved.
The picture which the apostle Paul has drawn of the
professed people of God in the last days is a sad but faithful delineation of the popular churches of our time. “Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof,” “lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God,” “lovers of their
own selves, covetous, boasters, proud,” (2 Timothy 3:2-7)—
such are a few specifications from the dark catalogue which
He has given. And in view of the frequent and startling revelations of crime, even among those that minister in holy
things, who dare affirm that there is one sin enumerated by
the apostle which is not concealed under a profession of
Christianity?
“But what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness?” “And what concord hath Christ with Belial?”
“And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols?
For ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath said, I
will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God,
and they shall be My people. Wherefore come out from
among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch
not the unclean, and I will receive you, and will be a Father
unto you, and ye shall be My sons and daughters, saith the
Lord Almighty.” 2 Corinthians 6:14-18.
At the proclamation of the first angel’s message, the
people of God were in Babylon; and many true Christians are still to be found in her communion. Not a few
who have never seen the special truths for this time are
dissatisfied with their present position, and are longing
for clearer light. They look in vain for the image of Christ
in the church. As the churches depart more and more widely
from the truth, and ally themselves more closely with the
world, the time will come when those who fear and honor
God can no longer remain in connection with them. Those

204

that “believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness,” will be left to receive “strong delusion,” and to
“believe a lie.” 2 Thessalonians 2:11, 12. Then the spirit of
persecution will again be revealed. But the light of truth
will shine upon all whose hearts are open to receive it,
and all the children of the Lord still in Babylon, will heed
the call, “Come out of her, my people.”

— The Tarrying Time

———————————————————————

There is often weeping with the night

that the morning cometh, when weeping shall be no more —
To those who discover the great Advent truth, there will be
many a disappointment before that great day breaks upon us
all —

———————————————————————

When the year 1843 entirely passed away unmarked
by the advent of Jesus, those who had looked in faith for
His appearing were for a time left in doubt and perplexity. But notwithstanding their disappointment, many continued to search the Scriptures, examining anew the evidences of their faith, and carefully studying the prophecies
to obtain further light. The Bible testimony in support of
their position seemed clear and conclusive. Signs which could
not be mistaken pointed to the coming of Christ as near. The
believers could not explain their disappointment; yet they
felt assured that God had led them in their past experience.
Their faith was greatly strengthened by the direct and
forcible application of those scriptures which set forth a
tarrying time. As early as 1842, the Spirit of God had moved
upon Charles Fitch to devise the prophetic chart, which was
generally regarded by Adventists as a fulfillment of the command given by the prophet Habakkuk, “to write the vision
and make it plain upon tables.” No one, however, then saw
the tarrying time, which was brought to view in the same
prophecy. After the disappointment, the full meaning of this
scripture became apparent. Thus speaks the prophet: “Write
the vision, and make it plain upon tables, that he may run

206

The

Great

Controversy

that readeth it. For the vision is yet for an appointed time,
but at the end it shall speak, and not lie: though it tarry, wait
for it; because it will surely come, it will not tarry.” Habakkuk
2:2, 3.
A portion of Ezekiel’s prophecy also was a source of much
strength and comfort to believers: “And the word of the Lord
came unto me, saying, Son of man, what is that proverb that
ye have in the land of Israel, saying, The days are prolonged,
and every vision faileth? Tell them therefore, Thus saith the
Lord God:” “The days are at hand, and the effect of every
vision.” “I will speak, and the word that I shall speak shall
come to pass; it shall be no more prolonged.” “They of the
house of Israel say, The vision that he seeth is for many days
to come, and he prophesieth of the times that are far off.
Therefore say unto them, Thus saith the Lord God: There
shall none of My words be prolonged any more, but the word
which I have spoken shall be done.” Ezekiel 12:21-25, 27,
28.
The waiting ones rejoiced that He who knows the end
from the beginning had looked down through the ages,
and, foreseeing their disappointment, had given them
words of courage and hope. Had it not been for such portions of Scripture, showing that they were in the right path,
their faith would have failed in that trying hour.
In the parable of the ten virgins, Matthew 25, the experience of Adventists is illustrated by the incidents of
an Eastern marriage. “Then shall the kingdom of Heaven
be likened unto ten virgins, which took their lamps, and went
forth to meet the bridegroom.” “While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept.” The wide-spread movement under the proclamation of the first message, answered
to the going forth of the virgins, while the passing of the
time of expectation, the disappointment, and the delay, were
represented by the tarrying of the bridegroom. After the definite time had passed, the true believers were still united in
the belief that the end of all things was at hand; but it soon
became evident that they were losing, to some extent, their
zeal and devotion, and were falling into the state denoted in

The T
arrying T
ime
Tarrying
Time

[392-395]

207

the parable by the slumbering of the virgins during the tarrying time.
About this time, fanaticism began to appear. Some who
professed to be zealous believers in the message rejected the
word of God as the one infallible guide, and, claiming to be
led by the Spirit, gave themselves up to the control of their
own feelings, impressions, and imaginations. There were
some who manifested a blind and bigoted zeal, denouncing
all who would not sanction their course. Their fanatical ideas
and exercises met with no sympathy from the great body of
Adventists; yet they served to bring reproach upon the cause
of truth.
Satan was seeking by this means to oppose and destroy the work of God. The people had been greatly stirred
by the Advent movement, thousands of sinners had been
converted, and faithful men were giving themselves to the
work of proclaiming the truth, even in the tarrying time. The
prince of evil was losing his subjects; and in order to bring
reproach upon the cause of God, he sought to deceive those
who professed the faith, and to drive them to extremes. Then
his agents stood ready to seize upon every error, every failure, every unbecoming act, and hold it up before the people
in the most exaggerated light, to render Adventists and their
faith odious. Thus the greater the number whom he could
crowd in to make a profession of the Advent faith while his
power controlled their hearts, the greater advantage would
he gain by calling attention to them as representatives of the
whole body of believers.
Satan is an accuser of the brethren, and it is his spirit
which inspires men to watch for the errors and defects of the
Lord’s people, and to hold them up to notice, while their
good deeds are passed by without a mention. He is always
active when God is at work for the salvation of souls. When
the sons of God come to present themselves before the Lord,
Satan comes also among them. In every revival he is ready
to bring in those who are unsanctified in heart and unbalanced in mind. When they have accepted some points of truth,
and gained a place with believers, he works through them to

208

The

Controversy

introduce theories that will deceive the unwary. No man is
proved to be a true Christian because he is found in company with the children of God, even in the house of worship
and around the table of the Lord. Satan is frequently there
upon the most solemn occasions, in the form of those whom
he can use as his agents.
The great deceiver will profess anything, in order to
gain adherents. But should he claim to be converted, should
he, if it were possible, enter Heaven and associate with the
angels, he would not be changed in character. While the true
worshipers would be bowed in adoration before their Maker,
he would be plotting mischief against God’s cause and
people, devising means to ensnare souls, considering the most
successful method of sowing tares.
Satan contests every inch of ground over which God’s
people advance in their journey toward the heavenly city.
In all the history of the church, no reformation has been carried forward without encountering serious obstacles. Thus it
was in Paul’s day. Wherever the apostle would raise up a
church, there were some who professed to receive the faith,
but who brought in heresies, that, if received, would eventually crowd out the love of the truth. Luther suffered great
perplexity and distress from the course of fanatical persons
who claimed that God had spoken directly through them,
and who therefore set their own ideas and opinions above
the testimony of the Scriptures. Many who were lacking in
faith and experience, but who had considerable self-sufficiency, and who loved to hear and tell some new thing, were
beguiled by the pretensions of the new teachers, and they
joined the agents of Satan in their work of tearing down what
God had moved Luther to build up. The Wesleys also, and
others who blessed the world by their influence and their
faith, encountered at every step the wiles of Satan in pushing over-zealous, unbalanced, and unsanctified ones into fanaticism of every grade.
Wm. Miller had no sympathy with those influences
that led to fanaticism. He declared, with Martin Luther,
that every spirit should be tested by the word of God:

“The devil has great power over the minds of some at the
present day. And how shall we know what manner of spirit
they are of? The Bible answers: ‘By their fruits ye shall know
them.’ ” “There are many spirits gone out into the world;
and we are commanded to try the spirits. The spirit that does
not cause us to live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this
present world, is not the spirit of Christ. I am more and more
convinced that Satan has much to do in these wild movements.” “Many among us, who pretend to be wholly sanctified, are following the traditions of men, and apparently are
as ignorant of truth as others who make no such pretensions,
and are not half so modest.” “The spirit of error will lead us
from the truth; and the Spirit of God will lead us into truth.
But, say you, a man may be in error, and think he has the
truth. What then? We answer, The Spirit and word agree. If
a man judges himself by the word of God, and finds a perfect harmony through the whole word, then he must believe
he has the truth; but if he finds the spirit by which he is led
does not harmonize with the whole tenor of God’s law or
book, then let him walk carefully, lest he be caught in the
snare of the devil.” “I have often obtained more evidence of
inward piety from a kindling eye, a wet cheek, and a choked
utterance, than from all the noise in Christendom.”
The enemies of the Reformation charged all the evils
of fanaticism upon the very ones who were laboring most
earnestly against it. A similar course was pursued by the
opposers of the Advent movement. And not content with
misrepresenting and exaggerating the errors of extremists
and fanatics, they circulated unfavorable reports that had not
the slightest semblance of truth. These persons were actuated by prejudice and hatred. Their peace was disturbed
by the proclamation of Christ at the door. They feared it
might be true, yet hoped it was not, and this was the
secret of their warfare against Adventists and their faith.
The fact that a few fanatics worked their way into the
ranks of Adventists is no more a reason to decide that the
movement was not of God, than is the presence of fanatics
and deceivers in the church in Paul’s or Luther’s day a suffi-

cient excuse for discarding or ridiculing their work. Let the
people of God arouse out of sleep, and begin in earnest the
work of repentance and reformation, let them search the
Scriptures to learn the truth as it is in Jesus, let them make
an entire consecration to God, and evidence will not be wanting that Satan is still active and vigilant. With all possible
deception will he manifest his power, calling to his aid all
the fallen angels of his realm.
It was not the proclamation of the Advent message that
created fanaticism and division. These appeared in the summer of 1844, when Adventists were in a state of doubt
and perplexity concerning their real position. The
preaching of the first message in 1843, and of the midnight cry in 1844, tended directly to repress fanaticism
and dissension. Those who participated in these solemn
movements were in harmony; their hearts were filled with
love for one another, and for Jesus, whom they expected soon
to see. The one faith, the one blessed hope, lifted them above
the control of any human influence, and proved a shield
against the assaults of Satan.

“While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and
slept. And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the
bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet Him. Then all those
virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps.” Matthew 25:5-7.
In the summer of 1844, Adventists discovered the mistake in their former reckoning of the prophetic periods,
and settled upon the correct position. The 2300 days of
Daniel 8:14, which all believed to extend to the second
coming of Christ, had been thought to end in the spring
of 1844; but it was now seen that this period extended to
the autumn of the same year, and the minds of Adventists
were fixed upon this point as the time for the Lord’s appearing. The proclamation of this time message was another step in the fulfillment of the parable of the marriage,
whose application to the experience of Adventists had already been clearly seen. As in the parable the cry was
raised at midnight announcing the approach of the bridegroom, so in the fulfillment, midway between the spring
of 1844, when it was first supposed that the 2300 days
would close, and the autumn of 1844, at which time it
was afterward found that they were really to close, such
a cry was raised, in the very words of Scripture: “Behold,

212

The

Great

Controversy

the Bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet Him.”
Like a tidal wave the movement swept over the land.
From city to city, from village to village, and into remote
country places it went, until the waiting people of God were
fully aroused. Before this proclamation, fanaticism disappeared, like early frost before the rising sun. Believers once
more found their position, and hope and courage animated their hearts. The work was free from those extremes
which are ever manifested when there is human excitement
without the controlling influence of the word and Spirit of
God. It was similar in character to those seasons of humiliation and returning unto the Lord which among ancient Israel
followed messages of reproof from His servants. It bore the
characteristics which mark the work of God in every age.
There was little ecstatic joy, but rather deep searching of
heart, confession of sin, and forsaking of the world. A preparation to meet the Lord was the burden of agonizing spirits.
There was persevering prayer, and unreserved consecration
to God.
Said Wm. Miller, in describing that work: “There is no
great expression of joy; that is, as it were, suppressed for a
future occasion, when all Heaven and earth will rejoice together with joy unspeakable and full of glory. There is no
shouting; that, too, is reserved for the shout from Heaven.
The singers are silent; they are waiting to join the angelic
hosts, the choir from Heaven. No arguments are used or
needed; all seem convinced that they have the truth. There is
no clashing of sentiments; all are of one heart and of one
mind.”
Of all the great religious movements since the days of
the apostles, none have been more free from human imperfection and the wiles of Satan than was that of the
autumn of 1844. Even now, after the lapse of forty years, all
who shared in that movement and who have stood firm upon
the platform of truth, still feel the holy influence of that
blessed work, and bear witness that it was of God.
At the call, “The Bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet
Him,” the waiting ones “arose and trimmed their lamps;”

The Midnight Cry

[399-403]

213

they studied the word of God with an intensity of interest
before unknown. Angels were sent from Heaven to arouse
those who had become discouraged, and prepare them to receive the message. The work did not stand in the wisdom
and learning of men, but in the power of God. It was not
the most talented, but the most humble and devoted, who
were the first to hear and obey the call. Farmers left their
crops standing in the fields, mechanics laid down their tools,
and with tears and rejoicing went out to give the warning.
Those who had formerly led in the cause were among the
last to join in this movement. The churches in general closed
their doors against it, and a large company who had the
living testimony withdrew from their connection. In the
providence of God, this cry united with the second angel’s
message, and gave power to that work.
The midnight cry was not so much carried by argument,
though the Scripture proof was clear and conclusive. There
went with it an impelling power that moved the soul. There
was no doubt, no questioning. Upon the occasion of Christ’s
triumphal entry into Jerusalem, the people who were assembled from all parts of the land to keep the feast, flocked
to the Mount of Olives, and as they joined the throng that
were escorting Jesus, they caught the inspiration of the hour,
and helped to swell the shout, “Blessed is He that cometh in
the name of the Lord!” Matthew 21:9. In like manner did
unbelievers who flocked to the Adventist meetings—some
from curiosity, some merely to ridicule—feel the convincing
power attending the message, “Behold, the Bridegroom
cometh!”
At that time there was faith that brought answers to
prayer,—faith that had respect to the recompense of reward. Like showers of rain upon the thirsty earth, the Spirit
of grace descended upon the earnest seekers. Those who expected soon to stand face to face with their Redeemer felt a
solemn joy that was unutterable. The softening, subduing
power of the Holy Spirit melted the heart, as wave after wave
of the glory of God swept over the faithful, believing ones.
Carefully and solemnly those who received the mes-

214

The

Controversy

sage came up to the time when they hoped to meet their
Lord. Every morning they felt that it was their first duty to
secure the evidence of their acceptance with God. Their hearts
were closely united, and they prayed much with and for one
another. They often met together in secluded places to commune with God, and the voice of intercession ascended to
Heaven from the fields and groves. The assurance to the
Saviour’s approval was more necessary to them than their
daily food, and if a cloud darkened their minds, they did not
rest until it was swept away. As they felt the witness of pardoning grace, they longed to behold Him whom their souls
loved.
But again they were destined to disappointment. The
time of expectation passed, and their Saviour did not
appear. With unwavering confidence they had looked forward to His coming, and now they felt as did Mary, when,
coming to the Saviour’s tomb and finding it empty, she exclaimed with weeping, “They have taken away my Lord, and
I know not where they have laid Him.” John 20:13.
A feeling of awe, a fear that the message might be true,
had for a time served as a restraint upon the unbelieving
world. After the passing of the time, this did not at once
disappear; they dared not triumph over the disappointed ones;
but as no tokens of God’s wrath were seen, they recovered
from their fears, and resumed their reproach and ridicule. A
large class who had professed to believe in the Lord’s
soon coming, renounced their faith. Some who had been
very confident were so deeply wounded in their pride that
they felt like fleeing from the world. Like Jonah, they complained of God, and chose death rather than life. Those who
had based their faith upon the opinions of others, and not
upon the word of God, were now as ready to again exchange
their views. The scoffers won the weak and cowardly to
their ranks, and all united in declaring that there could
be no more fears or expectations now. The time had passed,
the Lord had not come, and the world might remain the same
for thousands of years.
The earnest, sincere believers had given up all for Christ,

The Midnight Cry

[403-405]

215

and had shared His presence as never before. They had, as
they believed, given their last warning to the world, and, expecting soon to be received into the society of their divine
Master and the heavenly angels, they had, to a great extent,
withdrawn from the unbelieving multitude. With intense desire they had prayed, “Come, Lord Jesus, and come
quickly.” But He had not come. And now to take up again
the heavy burden of life’s cares and perplexities, and to endure the taunts and sneers of a scoffing world, was indeed a
terrible trial of faith and patience.
Yet this disappointment was not so great as was that
experienced by the disciples at the time of Christ’s first
advent. When Jesus rode triumphantly into Jerusalem, His
followers believed that He was about to ascend the throne of
David, and deliver Israel from her oppressors. With high
hopes and joyful anticipations they vied with one another in
showing honor to their King. Many spread their outer garments as a carpet in His path, or strewed before Him the
leafy branches of the palm. In their enthusiastic joy they
united in the glad acclaim, “Hosanna to the Son of David!”
When the Pharisees, disturbed and angered by this outburst
of rejoicing, wished Jesus to rebuke His disciples, He replied, “If these should hold their peace, the stones would
immediately cry out.” Luke 19:40. Prophecy must be fulfilled. The disciples were accomplishing the purpose of God;
yet they were doomed to a bitter disappointment. But a few
days had passed ere they witnessed the Saviour’s agonizing
death, and laid Him in the tomb. Their expectations had not
been realized in a single particular, and their hopes died with
Jesus. Not till their Lord had come forth triumphant from
the grave could they perceive that all had been foretold by
prophecy, and “that Christ must needs have suffered, and
risen again from the dead.” Acts 17:3. In like manner was
prophecy fulfilled in the first and second angels’ messages.
They were given at the right time, and accomplished the work
which God designed to accomplish by them.
The world had been looking on, expecting that if the
time passed and Christ did not appear, the whole system

216

The

Great

Controversy

of Adventism would be given up. But while many, under
strong temptation, yielded their faith, there were some who
stood firm. They could detect no error in their reckoning
of the prophetic periods. The ablest of their opponents
had not succeeded in overthrowing their position. True,
there had been a failure as to the expected event, but
even this could not shake their faith in the word of God.
When Jonah proclaimed in the streets of Nineveh that within
forty days the city would be overthrown, the Lord accepted
the humiliation of the Ninevites, and extended their period
of probation; yet the message of Jonah was sent of God, and
Nineveh was tested according to His will. Adventists believed that God had in like manner led them to warn the world
of the coming Judgment, and notwithstanding their disappointment, they felt assured that they had reached a most
important crisis.
The parable of the wicked servant was regarded as applying to those who desired to put off the coming of the Lord:
“If that evil servant shall say in his heart, My lord delayeth
His coming; and shall begin to smite his fellow-servants,
and to eat and drink with the drunken; the lord of that servant shall come in a day when He looketh not for Him, and
in an hour that he is not aware of, and shall cut him asunder,
and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites.” Matthew
24:48-51.
The feelings of those who held fast the Advent truth
are expressed in the words of Wm. Miller: “Were I to
live my life over again, with the same evidence that I
then had, to be honest with God and men I should have
to do as I have done.” “I hope I have cleansed my garments
from the blood of souls; I feel that, as far as possible, I have
freed myself from all guilt in their condemnation.” “Although
I have been twice disappointed,” wrote this man of God, “I
am not yet cast down or discouraged.” “My hope in the coming of Christ is as strong as ever. I have done only what,
after years of sober consideration, I felt it my solemn duty to
do. If I have erred, it has been on the side of charity, the love
of my fellow-man, and my conviction of duty to God.” “One

The Midnight Cry

[405-408]

217

thing I do know, I have preached nothing but what I believed;
and God’s hand has been with me, His power has been manifested in the work, and much good has been effected.” “Many
thousands, to all human appearance, have been made to study
the Scriptures by the preaching of the time; and by that means,
through faith and the sprinkling of the blood of Christ, have
been reconciled to God.” “I have never courted the smiles of
the proud, nor quailed when the world frowned. I shall not
now purchase their favor, nor shall I go beyond duty to tempt
their hate. I shall never seek my life at their hands, nor shrink,
I hope, from losing it, if God in His good providence so orders.”
God did not forsake His people; His Spirit still abode
with those who did not rashly deny the light which they
had received, and denounce the Advent movement. The
apostle Paul, looking down through the ages, had written
words of encouragement and warning for the tried, waiting
ones at this crisis: “Cast not away therefore your confidence,
which hath great recompense of reward. For ye have need of
patience, that, after ye have done the will of God, ye might
receive the promise. For yet a little while, and He that shall
come will come, and will not tarry. Now the just shall live by
faith; but if any man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him. But we are not of them who draw back unto
perdition, but of them that believe to the saving of the soul.”
Hebrews 10:35-39.
The people here addressed were in danger of making shipwreck of faith. They had done the will of God in following
the guidance of His Spirit and His word; yet they could not
understand His purpose in their past experience, nor could
they discern the pathway before them, and they were tempted
to doubt whether God had indeed been leading them. At this
time the words were specially applicable, “Now the just shall
live by faith.” As the bright light of the midnight cry had
shone upon their pathway, and they had seen the prophecies
unsealed, and the rapidly fulfilling signs telling that the coming of Christ was near, Adventists had walked, as it were, by
sight. But now, bowed down by disappointed hopes, they

218

The

Great

Controversy

could stand only by faith in God and in His word. The scoffing world were saying, “You have been deceived. Give up
your faith, and say that the Advent movement was of Satan.” But God’s word declared, “If any man draw back, my
soul shall have no pleasure in him.” To renounce their faith
now, and deny the power of the Holy Spirit which had
attended the message, would be drawing back toward
perdition. They were encouraged to steadfastness by the
words of Paul, “Cast not away therefore your confidence;”
“ye have need of patience;” “for yet a little while, and He
that shall come will come, and will not tarry.” Their only
safe course was to cherish the light which they had already received of God, hold fast to His promises, and
continue to search the Scriptures, and patiently wait and
watch to receive further light.

The scripture which above all others had been both
the foundation and central pillar of the Advent faith was
the declaration, “Unto two thousand and three hundred
days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.” Daniel 8:14.
These had been familiar words to all believers in the Lord’s
soon coming. By the lips of thousands was this prophecy
joyfully repeated as the watchword of their faith. All felt
that upon the events therein brought to view depended their
brightest expectations and most cherished hopes. These prophetic days had been shown to terminate in the autumn of
1844. In common with the rest of the Christian world,
Adventists then held that the earth, or some portion of
it, was the sanctuary, and that the cleansing of the sanctuary was the purification of the earth by the fires of the
last great day. This they understood would take place at the

220

The

Great

Controversy

second coming of Christ. Hence the conclusion that Christ
would return to the earth in 1844.
But the appointed time came, and the Lord did not appear. The believers knew that God’s word could not fail;
their interpretation of the prophecy must be at fault; but
where was the mistake? Many rashly cut the knot of difficulty by denying that the 2300 days ended in 1844. No reason could be given for this position, except that Christ had
not come at the time of expectation. They argued that if the
prophetic days had ended in 1844, Christ would then have
come to cleanse the sanctuary by the purification of the earth
by fire; and that since He had not come, the days could not
have ended.
To accept this conclusion was to renounce the former reckoning of the prophetic periods, and involve the whole question in confusion. It was a deliberate surrender of positions
which had been reached through earnest, prayerful study of
the Scriptures, by minds enlightened by the Spirit of God,
and hearts burning with its living power; positions which
had withstood the most searching criticism and the most bitter opposition of popular religionists and worldly-wise men,
and which had stood firm against the combined forces of
learning and eloquence, and the taunts and revilings alike of
the honorable and the base. And all this sacrifice was made
in order to maintain the theory that the earth is the sanctuary.
God had led His people in the great Advent movement; His power and glory had attended the work, and
He would not permit it to end in darkness and disappointment, to be reproached as a false and fanatical excitement. He would not leave His word involved in doubt
and uncertainty. Though the majority of Adventists abandoned their former reckoning of the prophetic periods, and
consequently denied the correctness of the movement based
thereon, a few were unwilling to renounce points of faith
and experience that were sustained by the Scriptures and by
the special witness of the Spirit of God. They believed that
they had adopted sound principles of interpretation in their
study of the Scriptures, and that it was their duty to hold fast

The

Sanctuary

[409-414]

221

the truths already gained, and to still pursue the same course
of Biblical research. With earnest prayer they reviewed their
position, and studied the Scriptures to discover their mistake. As they could see no error in their explanation of
the prophetic periods, they were led to examine more
closely the subject of the sanctuary.
In their investigation they learned, that the earthly sanctuary, built by Moses at the command of God, according to
the pattern shown him in the mount, was “a figure for the
time then present, in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices;” that its two holy places were “patterns of things in
the heavens;” that Christ, our great High Priest, is “a minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the
Lord pitched, and not man;” that “Christ is not entered into
the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of
the true, but into Heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us.” Hebrews 9:9, 23; 8:2, 9:24.
The sanctuary in Heaven, in which Jesus ministers in
our behalf, is the great original, of which the sanctuary
built by Moses was a copy. God placed His Spirit upon the
builders of the earthly sanctuary. The artistic skill displayed
in its construction was a manifestation of divine wisdom.
The walls had the appearance of massive gold, reflecting in
every direction the light of the seven lamps of the golden
candlestick. The table of show-bread and the altar of incense
glittered like burnished gold. The gorgeous curtain which
formed the ceiling, inwrought with figures of angels in blue
and purple and scarlet, added to the beauty of the scene. And
beyond the second vail was the holy shekinah, the visible
manifestation of God’s glory, before which none but the high
priest could enter and live. The matchless splendor of the
earthly tabernacle reflected to human vision the glories of
that heavenly temple where Christ our forerunner ministers
for us before the throne of God.
As the sanctuary on earth had two apartments, the
holy and the most holy, so there are two holy places in
the sanctuary in Heaven. And the ark containing the law
of God, the altar of incense, and other instruments of service

CHAPTER SUPPLEMENT
ANIEL’S AMAZING PROPHECIES
SUPPLEMENT:: D
DANIEL’S

The master prophecy of the Bible is given in Daniel 8. This chapter closely
connects with Daniel 7 and 9, and should be studied with them.
DANIEL 7 (written in 553-552 B.C.) reveals world history from Daniel’s
time down to the second advent of Christ. In vision, Daniel sees four world
empires symbolized as beasts, followed by a little horn power (Dan 7:1-8,
15-21, 23-25). The Investigative Judgment then convenes in heaven (Dan
7:9-10, 13, 22, 26). And, after that, history ends with the second advent of
Christ (Dan 7:14, 27-28).
The animals in Daniel 7 parallel the parts of the metal image of Daniel 2.
The lion in chapter 7 is Babylon (605-538 B.C.). The bear is Medo-Persia
(538-331 B.C.). The leopard beast is Grecia (331-301 B.C., at which time it
becomes divided into four kingdoms which continue on until around 168
B.C.). The terrible beast is Pagan Rome (168 B.C. to the 5th Century A.D.,
when it becomes broken into ten kingdoms). The little horn is Papal Rome,
which gained full power by A.D. 538, after uprooting three kingdoms (the
Heruli, Vandals, and Ostrogoths).
DANIEL 8 is composed of two major parts. The first is an EVENT prophecy that closely parallels the prophecy of Daniel 7. This prophecy is about
two beasts and a little horn that follows them (Dan 8:1-12, 20-25). The first
beast, a ram, is Medo-Persia (538-334 B.C.), and the he-goat which struck it
down was Grecia (334-168 B.C.). The “notable horn” was Alexander the
Great who, before his death in 323, carved out the largest empire in history
up to that time—in only ten years. When he was broken off in the prime of
life, the empire divided into four sections. The little horn is Pagan Rome which,
historians tell us, was taken over by Papal Rome. Much of Daniel 7 and 8
(7:8, 19-26 and 8:9-12, 23-25) is given to a concern over this power which

The

Sanctuary

223

would speak blasphemies (7:8, 20; 8:11), seek to kill God’s people (7:21, 25;
8:10, 24-25), cast down the truth to the ground (8:12, 25), tear God’s Sanctuary down from heaven (8:11), and even try to change the law of God (7:25).
Revelation 13 (read verses 6-7, for example) deals with the same little horn
power—the Papacy.
But there is a second part to Daniel 8: This is a TIME prophecy (Dan 8:1314, 26). The prophecy itself is given in Daniel 8:14. “Unto two thousand and
three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.” Careful reading
of this chapter reveals that, while the angel Gabriel was told to explain the
vision of Daniel 8 to the prophet (8:16), only the event prophecy was explained (8:17-25) while the time prophecy was only referred to (8:26). Daniel
nearly fainted under the burden (8:27), and the prayer of Daniel 9 is the result.
DANIEL 9 begins with the prophet’s prayer for guidance and help for his
people (Dan 9:1-19). Gabriel, the one whom he had seen in his earlier vision
(9:21), is then sent in answer to his prayer (9:20), in order to complete the
explanation (9:22-23).
THE LLONGEST
ONGEST PROPHECY BEGINS. The 70 week prophecy (Dan 9:2427) is the first part of the 2300 day prophecy. Seventy weeks are “determined” (“cut off” in Hebrew—cut off from the larger 2300 day [year] prophecy) for the Jews. Therefore, the first part of the 2300 day prophecy of Daniel
8:14 is time allocated to the Jews, to conclude their probation as God’s specially favored nation.
In Bible prophecy, a day equals a year (Num 14:34; Ezek 4:6). The decree
of Artaxerxes, given in his seventh year as king, in 457 B.C. (Dan 9:25; Ezra
6:14; 7:6-8), restoring the Jewish government, begins this vast time prophecy of 2300 years. The first 70 weeks (Dan 9:24-27) of this prophecy, cut off
or allotted to the Jews, equals 490 years. The walls of Jerusalem were rebuilt
in 7 weeks, or 49 years (408 B.C.). Another 62 weeks brings us to the anointing of Christ for His mission in A.D. 27. Now 483 years are past; only 1 week
remains of the 70. In the midst of this week (Dan 9:26-27), A.D. 31, the
Messiah is cut off, crucified. A second half-week of 3½ years brings us to
A.D. 34, when at the stoning of Stephen the gospel is taken to the Gentiles.
THE LLONGEST
ONGEST PROPHECY ENDS. In A.D. 34 the 70 weeks, or 490 years,
is completed. There remains 1310 years of this longest Bible prophecy, of
Daniel 8:14, to be fulfilled. At its termination, in A.D. 1844, began the “cleansing of the sanctuary” predicted in this important passage of Daniel 8:14.
Jesus is our High Priest in the heavenly Sanctuary (the pattern of the
earthly). In 1844, He began His final work in it, prior to His second advent to
the earth for His people.

The sanctuary in the wilderness was constructed under the direction of Moses,
in accordance with the pattern shown him in the mount (Ex 25:7-8, 40; Heb 8:5).
Enclosing this wilderness tabernacle was an OUTER COURT which was made
of white curtains attached to poles (Ex 27:9-18), and was about 75 feet wide by
TAR OF
150 feet long (based on an 18-inch cubit). Within the Court was the AL

Brazen Altar since there was a second altar (the Golden Altar) inside the Tabernacle. This outside (Ex 27:1-9) altar was hollow inside, overlaid with brass, and
was 5 feet high and 7½ feet square. Upon this altar were placed the animals that
were offered as burnt sacrifice. Just beyond, stood the brass LAVER (Ex 30:1821), where the priests washed before entering the Tabernacle.

About 15 by 45 feet in size, this Tabernacle was portable, so it could be taken

Incense, or Golden Altar (Ex 30:1-10), from whence the smoke of a specially
prepared incense wafted up, over the top of the dividing veil (which did not reach
to the ceiling) and into the Holy of Holies beyond. Upon the Golden Altar and
dividing veil, the priest sprinkled some of the sacrificial blood (Lev 4-5). A partial description of this may be found in Hebrews 9:1-7. All of the furniture within
the First and Second Apartments was of solid gold, or covered with gold.

found in the sanctuary below, have also their counterpart in
the sanctuary above. In holy vision the apostle John was permitted to enter Heaven, and he there beheld the candlestick
and the altar of incense, and as “the temple of God was
opened,” he beheld also “the ark of His testament.” Revelation 4:5; 8:3; 11:19.
Those who were seeking for the truth found indisputable proof of the existence of a sanctuary in Heaven.
Moses made the earthly sanctuary after a pattern which was
shown him. Paul declares that that pattern was the true sanctuary which is in Heaven. John testifies that he saw it in
Heaven.
In the temple in Heaven, the dwelling-place of God,
His throne is established in righteousness and judgment.
In the most holy place is His law, the great rule of right
by which all mankind are tested. The ark that enshrines
the tables of the law is covered with the mercy-seat, before
which Christ pleads His blood in the sinner’s behalf. Thus is
represented the union of justice and mercy in the plan of
human redemption. This union infinite wisdom alone could
devise, and infinite power accomplish; it is a union that fills
all Heaven with wonder and adoration. The cherubim of the
earthly sanctuary looking reverently down upon the mercyseat, represent the interest with which the heavenly host contemplate the work of redemption. This is the mystery of mercy
into which angels desire to look,—that God can be just while
He justifies the repenting sinner, and renews His intercourse
with the fallen race; that Christ could stoop to raise unnumbered multitudes from the abyss of ruin, and clothe them
with the spotless garments of His own righteousness, to unite
with angels who have never fallen, and to dwell forever in
the presence of God.
At the termination of the 2300 days, in 1844, no sanctuary had existed on earth for many centuries; therefore
the sanctuary in Heaven must be the one brought to view
in the declaration, “Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.” But
how could a sanctuary in Heaven need cleansing? Turn-

The

Sanctuary

[414-419]

227

ing again to the Scriptures, the students of prophecy learned
that the cleansing was not a removal of physical impurities,
for it was to be accomplished with blood, and therefore must
be a cleansing from sin. Thus says the apostle: “It was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the Heavens
should be purified with these [the blood of animals]; but the
heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these
[even the precious blood of Christ].” Hebrews 9:23. To obtain a further knowledge of the cleansing to which the prophecy points, it was necessary to understand the ministration
of the heavenly sanctuary. This could be learned only from
the ministration of the earthly sanctuary; for Paul declares
that the priests who officiated there served “unto the example
and shadow of heavenly things.” Hebrews 8:5.
The ministration of the earthly sanctuary consisted
of two divisions: the priests ministered daily in the holy
place, while once a year the high priest performed a special work of atonement in the most holy, for the cleansing of the sanctuary. Day by day the repentant sinner brought
his offering to the door of the tabernacle, and, placing his
hand upon the victim’s head, confessed his sins, thus in figure transferring them to the innocent sacrifice. The animal
was then slain, and the blood or the flesh was carried by the
priest into the holy place. Thus the sin was, in figure, transferred to the sanctuary. Such was the work that went
forward throughout the year. The continual transfer of
sins to the sanctuary, rendered a further work of ministration necessary in order for their removal. On the tenth
day of the seventh month the high priest entered the inner
apartment, or most holy place, which he was forbidden, on
pain of death, to enter at any other time. The cleansing of
the sanctuary then performed completed the yearly
round of service.
On the great day of atonement, two kids of the goats were
brought to the door of the tabernacle, and lots were cast upon
them, “one lot for the Lord, and the other lot for the scapegoat.” The goat upon which fell the lot for the Lord was to
be slain as a sin-offering for the people. And the priest was

228

The

Great

Controversy

to bring his blood within the vail, and sprinkle it upon the
mercy-seat, and before the mercy-seat. “And he shall make
an atonement for the holy place, because of the uncleanness
of the children of Israel, and because of their transgressions
in all their sins; and so shall he do for the tabernacle of the
congregation, that remaineth among them in the midst of
their uncleanness.” Leviticus 16:8, 16.
“And Aaron shall lay both his hands upon the head of the
live goat, and confess over him all the iniquities of the children of Israel, and all their transgressions in all their sins,
putting them upon the head of the goat, and shall send him
away by the hand of a fit man into the wilderness; and the
goat shall bear upon him all their iniquities unto a land not
inhabited.” Leviticus 16:21, 22. The scape-goat came no
more into the camp of Israel, and the man who led him away
was required to wash himself and his clothing with water
before returning to the camp.
The whole ceremony was designed to impress the Israelites with the holiness of God and His abhorrence of
sin, and, further, to show them that they could not come in
contact with sin without becoming polluted. Every man was
required to afflict his soul while this work of atonement was
going forward. All business was laid aside, and the whole
congregation of Israel spent the day in solemn humiliation
before God, with prayer, fasting, and deep searching of heart.
Important truths concerning the atonement may be
learned from the typical service. A substitute was accepted
in the sinner’s stead; but the sin was not canceled by the
blood of the victim. A means was thus provided by which it
was transferred to the sanctuary. By the offering of blood,
the sinner acknowledged the authority of the law, confessed
his guilt in transgression, and expressed his desire for pardon through faith in a Redeemer to come; but he was not
yet entirely released from the condemnation of the law.
On the day of atonement the high priest, having taken
an offering from the congregation, went into the most
holy place with the blood of this general offering, and
sprinkled it upon the mercy-seat, directly over the law,

The

Sanctuary

[419-422]

229

to make satisfaction for its claims. Then, in his character
of mediator, he took the sins upon himself, and bore them
from the sanctuary. Placing his hands upon the head of the
scape-goat, he confessed over him all these sins, thus in figure transferring them from himself to the goat. The goat then
bore them away, and they were regarded as forever separated from the people.
Such was the service performed “unto the example and
shadow of heavenly things.” And what was done in type in
the ministration of the earthly, is done in reality in the
ministration of the heavenly. After His ascension, our Saviour began His work as our high priest. Says Paul, “Christ is
not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are
the figures of the true; but into Heaven itself, now to appear
in the presence of God for us.” Hebrews 9:24. In harmony
with the typical service, He began His ministration in
the holy place, and at the termination of the prophetic
days in 1844, as foretold by Daniel the prophet, he entered the most holy to perform the last division of His
solemn work,—to cleanse the sanctuary.
As the sins of the people were anciently transferred,
in figure, to the earthly sanctuary by the blood of the
sin-offering, so our sins are, in fact, transferred to the
heavenly sanctuary by the blood of Christ. And as the
typical cleansing of the earthly was accomplished by the removal of the sins by which it had been polluted, so the actual cleansing of the heavenly is to be accomplished by
the removal, or blotting out, of the sins which are there
recorded. This necessitates an examination of the books of
record to determine who, through repentance of sin and faith
in Christ, are entitled to the benefits of His atonement. The
cleansing of the sanctuary therefore involves a work of
investigative Judgment. This work must be performed
prior to the coming of Christ to redeem His people; for
when He comes, His reward is with Him to give to every
man according to His works. Revelation 22:12.
Thus those who followed in the advancing light of the
prophetic word saw that instead of coming to the earth

230

The

Great

Controversy

at the termination of the 2300 days in 1844, Christ then
entered the most holy place of the heavenly sanctuary,
into the presence of God, to perform the closing work of
atonement, preparatory to His coming.
It was seen, also, that while the sin-offering pointed to
Christ as a sacrifice, and the high priest represented Christ
as a mediator, the scape-goat typified Satan, the author of
sin, upon whom the sins of the truly penitent will finally be
placed. When the high priest, by virtue of the blood of the
sin-offering, removed the sins from the sanctuary, he placed
them upon the scape-goat. When Christ, by virtue of His
own blood, removes the sins of His people from the heavenly sanctuary at the close of his ministration, He will
place them upon Satan, who, in the execution of the judgment, must bear the final penalty. The scape-goat was sent
away into a land not inhabited, never to come again into the
congregation of Israel. So will Satan be forever banished
from the presence of God and His people, and he will be
blotted from existence in the final destruction of sin and sinners.

The subject of the sanctuary was the key which unlocked the mystery of the disappointment, showing that
God had led His people in the great Advent movement.
It opened to view a complete system of truth, connected
and harmonious, and revealed present duty as it brought to
light the position and work of God’s people.
After the passing of the time of expectation, in 1844, Adventists still believed the Saviour’s coming to be very near;
they held that they had reached an important crisis, and that
the work of Christ as man’s intercessor before God, had
ceased. Having given the warning of the Judgment near, they
felt that their work for the world was done, and they lost
their burden of soul for the salvation of sinners, while the
bold and blasphemous scoffing of the ungodly seemed to
them another evidence that the Spirit of God had been withdrawn from the rejecters of His mercy. All this confirmed
them in the belief that probation had ended, or, as they then
expressed it, “the door of mercy was shut.”
But clearer light came with the investigation of the
sanctuary question. Now was seen the application of those
words of Christ in the Revelation, addressed to the church at
this very time: “These things saith He that is holy, He that is

232

The

Great

Controversy

true, He that hath the key of David, He that openeth and no
man shutteth, and shutteth and no man openeth; I know thy
works; behold, I have set before thee an open door, and no
man can shut it.” Revelation 3:7, 8. Here an open as well as
a shut door is brought to view. At the termination of the
2300 prophetic days in 1844, Christ changed His ministration from the holy to the most holy place. When, in the
ministration of the earthly sanctuary, the high priest on the
day of atonement entered the most holy place, the door of
the holy place was closed, and the door of the most holy was
opened. So, when Christ passed from the holy to the most
holy of the heavenly sanctuary, the door, or ministration, of
the former apartment was closed, and the door, or ministration, of the latter was opened. Christ had ended one part
of His work as our intercessor, to enter upon another
portion of the work; and He still presented His blood
before the Father in behalf of sinners. “Behold,” He declares, “I have set before thee an open door, and no man can
shut it.”
Those who by faith follow Jesus in the great work of
the atonement, receive the benefits of His mediation in
their behalf; but those who reject the light that brings to
view this work of ministration, are not benefited thereby.
The Jews who rejected the light given at Christ’s first advent, and refused to believe in Him as the Saviour of the
world, could not receive pardon through Him. When Jesus
at His ascension entered by His own blood into the heavenly
sanctuary to shed upon His disciples the blessings of His
mediation, the Jews were left in total darkness, to continue
their useless sacrifices and offerings. The ministration of
types and shadows had ceased. That door by which men had
formerly found access to God, was no longer open. The Jews
had refused to seek Him in the only way whereby He could
then be found, through the ministration in the sanctuary in
Heaven. Therefore they found no communion with God. To
them the door was shut. They had no knowledge of Christ as
the true sacrifice and the only mediator before God; hence
they could not receive the benefits of His mediation.

An Open and a Shut Door

[429-431]

233

The condition of the unbelieving Jews illustrates the condition of the careless and unbelieving among professed Christians, who are willingly ignorant of the work of our merciful
High Priest. In the typical service, when the high priest
entered the most holy place, all Israel were required to
gather about the sanctuary, and in the most solemn manner humble their souls before God, that they might receive the pardon of their sins, and not be cut off from the
congregation. How much more essential in this anti-typical
day of atonement that we understand the work of our High
Priest, and know what duties are required of us.
Men cannot with impunity reject the warnings which
God in mercy sends them. A message was sent from Heaven
to the world in Noah’s day, and their salvation depended upon
the manner in which they treated that message. Because they
rejected the warning, the Spirit of God was withdrawn from
that sinful race, and they perished in the waters of the flood.
In the time of Abraham, mercy ceased to plead with the guilty
inhabitants of Sodom, and all but Lot with his wife and two
daughters were consumed by the fire sent down from heaven.
So in the days of Christ. The Son of God declared to the
unbelieving Jews of that generation, “Your house is left unto
you desolate.” Matthew 23:38. Looking down to the last days,
the same infinite power declares, concerning those who “received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved,”
“For this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that
they should believe a lie; that they all might be damned who
believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.”
2 Thessalonians 2:10-12. As they reject the teachings of
His word, God withdraws His Spirit, and leaves them to
the deceptions which they love.
But Christ still intercedes in man’s behalf, and light
will be given to those who seek it. Though this was not at
first understood by Adventists, it was afterward made plain
as the scriptures which define their true position began to
open before them.
The passing of the time in 1844 was followed by a period of great trial to those who still held the Advent faith.

Their only relief, so far as ascertaining their true position was concerned, was the light which directed their
minds to the sanctuary above. As has been stated,
Adventists were for a short time united in the belief that the
door of mercy was shut. This position was soon abandoned.
Some renounced their faith in their former reckoning of the
prophetic periods, and ascribed to human or Satanic agencies the powerful influence of the Holy Spirit which had attended the Advent movement. Another class firmly held
that the Lord had led them in their past experience; and
as they waited and watched and prayed to know the will
of God, they saw that their great High Priest had entered upon another work of ministration, and, following
Him by faith, they were led to understand also the closing work of the church, and were prepared to receive
and give to the world the warning of the third angel of
Revelation 14.

———————————————————————

When Christ entered the most holy place of the heavenly sanctuary to perform the closing work of the atonement, He committed to His servants the last message of
mercy to be given to the world. Such is the warning of
the third angel of Revelation 14. Immediately following
its proclamation, the Son of man is seen by the prophet coming in glory to reap the harvest of the earth.
As foretold in the Scriptures, the ministration of Christ
in the most holy place began at the termination of the
prophetic days in 1844. To this time apply the words of the
Revelator, “The temple of God was opened in Heaven, and
there was seen in His temple the ark of His testament.” Revelation 11:19. The ark of God’s testament is in the second
apartment of the sanctuary. As Christ entered there, to
minister in the sinner’s behalf, the inner temple was
opened, and the ark of God was brought to view. To those
who by faith beheld the Saviour in His work of intercession,
God’s majesty and power were revealed. As the train of His

236

The

Great

Controversy

glory filled the temple, light from the holy of holies was shed
upon His waiting people on the earth.
They had by faith followed their High Priest from the holy
to the most holy, and they saw Him pleading His blood before the ark of God. Within that sacred ark is the Father’s
law, the same that was spoken by God Himself amid the
thunders of Sinai, and written with His own finger on
the tables of stone. Not one command has been annulled;
not a jot or tittle has been changed. While God gave to
Moses a copy of His law, He preserved the great original in
the sanctuary above. Tracing down its holy precepts, the
seekers for truth found, in the very bosom of the
decalogue, the fourth commandment, as it was first proclaimed: “Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy.
Six days shalt thou labor, and do all thy work; but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God: in it thou shalt
not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy
man-servant, nor thy maid-servant, nor thy cattle, nor thy
stranger that is within thy gates: for in six days the Lord
made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and
rested the seventh day; wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day, and hallowed it.” Exodus 20:8-11.
The Spirit of God impressed the hearts of these students
of His word. The conviction was urged upon them, that
they had ignorantly transgressed the fourth commandment by disregarding the Creator’s rest-day. They began to examine the reasons for observing the first day of the
week instead of the day which God had sanctified. They
could find no evidence in the Scriptures that the fourth
commandment had been abolished, or that the Sabbath
had been changed; the blessing which first hallowed the
seventh day had never been removed. They had been honestly seeking to know and do God’s will, and now, as they
saw themselves transgressors of His law, sorrow filled their
hearts. They at once evinced their loyalty to God by keeping His Sabbath holy.
Many and earnest were the efforts made to overthrow their
faith. None could fail to see that if the earthly sanctuary

The Mark of the Beast

[435-438]

237

was a figure or pattern of the heavenly, the law deposited in the ark on earth was an exact transcript of the
law in the ark in Heaven, and that an acceptance of the
truth concerning the heavenly sanctuary involved an acknowledgment of the claims of God’s law, and the obligation of the Sabbath of the fourth commandment. Here
was the secret of the bitter and determined opposition to the
harmonious exposition of the Scriptures that brought to view
the ministration of Christ in the heavenly sanctuary. How
hard men tried to close the door which God had opened, and
to open the door which He had closed! But “He that openeth
and no man shutteth, and shutteth and no man openeth,” had
declared, “Behold, I have set before thee an open door, and
no man can shut it.” Revelation 3:7, 8. Christ had opened
the door, or ministration, of the most holy place, light was
shining from that open door of the sanctuary in Heaven, and
the fourth commandment was shown to be included in the
law within the ark; what God had established, no man could
overthrow.
Those who had accepted the light concerning the mediation of Christ and the perpetuity of the law of God,
found that these were the truths brought to view in the
third message. The angel declares, “Here are they that
keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.”
This statement is preceded by a solemn and fearful warning:
“If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his
mark in his forehead, or in his hand, the same shall drink of
the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without
mixture into the cup of His indignation.” Revelation 14:9,
10. An interpretation of the symbols employed was necessary to an understanding of this message. What was represented by the beast, the image, and the mark? Again those
who were seeking for the truth returned to the study of the
prophecies.
In the book of the Revelation, under the symbols of a
great red dragon, a leopard-like beast, and a beast with
lamb-like horns, (Revelation 12; 13) are brought to view
those earthly governments which are especially engaged

1. And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a BEAST rise up out of
the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his horns ten crowns, and
upon his heads the name of blasphemy. 2. And the beast which I saw was like
unto a leapard, and his feet were as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as the
mouth of a lion; and the dragon gave him his power, and his seat, and great
authority.
3. And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death; and his deadly
wound was healed, and all the world wondered after the beast.
4. And they worshipped the DRAGON which gave power unto the beast;
and they worshipped the BEAST, saying, Who is like unto the beast? who is able
to make war with him? 5. And there was given unto him a MOUTH speaking
GREAT THINGS and BLASPHEMIES; and power was given unto him to continue
forty and two months. 6. And he opened his mouth in BLASPHEMY AGAINST
GOD, to blaspheme His name, and His tabernacle, and them that dwell in heaven.
7. And it was given unto him to make WAR WITH THE SAINTS, and to overcome
them: and POWER was given him over all kindreds, and tongues, and nations.
8. And all that dwell upon the earth shall WORSHIP him, whose names are
not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.
9. If any man have an ear, let him hear. 10. He that leadeth into captivity shall go
into captivity: he that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword. Here is
the patience and the faith of the saints.
11. And I beheld ANOTHER BEAST coming up out of the earth; and he had
two horns like a LAMB, and he spake as a DRAGON. 12. And he exerciseth all the
power of the first beast before him, and causeth the earth and them which dwell
therein to worship the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed. 13. And he
doeth great WONDERS, so that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the
earth in the sight of men. 14. And deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the
means of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast;
saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they should make an IMAGE TO THE
BEAST, which had the wound by a sword, and did live. 15. And he had power to
give life unto the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both
speak, and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast
should be killed.
16. And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond,
to receive a MARK in their right hand, or in their foreheads: And that no man
might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the NAME of the beast, or the
NUMBER of his name. 17. Here is wisdom: Let him that hath understanding
count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his NUMBER is
six hundred threesorce and six.

in trampling upon God’s law and persecuting His people.
Their war is carried forward to the close of time. The people
of God, symbolized by a holy woman and her children, are
greatly in the minority. In the last days only a remnant exists. John speaks of them as those that “keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.” Revelation 12:17.
Through the great powers controlled by paganism and
the papacy, symbolized by the dragon and the leopardlike beast, Satan for many centuries destroyed God’s
faithful witnesses. Under the dominion of Rome, they were
tortured and slain for more than a thousand years; but the
papacy was at last deprived of its strength, and forced to
desist from persecution. Revelation 13:3, 10. At that time
the prophet beheld a new power coming up, represented
by the beast with lamb-like horns. The appearance of this
beast and the manner of its rise seem to indicate that the
power which it represents is unlike those brought to view
under the preceding symbols. The great kingdoms that have
ruled the world obtained their dominion by conquest and revolution, and they were presented to the prophet Daniel as beasts
of prey, rising when the “four winds of the heaven strove
upon the great sea.” Daniel 7:2. But the beast with horns
like a lamb is seen “coming up out of the earth;” (Revelation
13:11) signifying that instead of overthrowing other powers
to establish itself, the nation thus represented arose in
territory previously unoccupied, and grew up gradually
and peacefully.
Here is a striking figure of the rise and growth of our
own nation. And the lamb-like horns, emblems of innocence
and gentleness, well represent the character of our government, as expressed in its two fundamental principles, Republicanism and Protestantism. The Christian exiles who first
fled to America, sought an asylum from royal oppression
and priestly intolerance, and they determined to establish a
government upon the broad foundation of civil and religious
liberty. These principles are the secret of our power and prosperity as a nation. Millions from other lands have sought our

240

The

Great

Controversy

shores, and the United States has risen to a place among the
most powerful nations of the earth.
But the stern tracings of the prophetic pencil reveal a
change in this peaceful scene. The beast with lamb-like
horns speaks with the voice of a dragon, and “exerciseth
all the power of the first beast before him.” The spirit of
persecution manifested by paganism and the papacy is
again to be revealed. Prophecy declares that this power will
say “to them that dwell on the earth, that they should make
an image to the beast.” Revelation 13:14. The image is made
to the first or leopard-like beast, which is the one brought to
view in the third angel’s message. By this first beast is represented the Roman Church, an ecclesiastical body
clothed with civil power, having authority to punish all
dissenters. The image to the beast represents another
religious body clothed with similar power. The formation
of this image is the work of that beast whose peaceful rise
and mild professions render it so striking a symbol of the
United States. Here is to be found an image of the papacy.
When the churches of our land, uniting upon such points
of faith as are held by them in common, shall influence
the State to enforce their decrees and sustain their institutions, then will Protestant America have formed an image of the Roman hierarchy. Then the true church will be
assailed by persecution, as were God’s ancient people. Almost every century furnishes examples of what bigotry and
malice can do under a plea of serving God by protecting the
rights of Church and State. Protestant churches that have
followed in the steps of Rome by forming alliance with
worldly powers have manifested a similar desire to restrict
liberty of conscience. In the seventeenth century thousands
of non-conformist ministers suffered under the rule of the
Church of England. Persecution always follows religious favoritism on the part of secular governments.
The beast with lamb-like horns commands “all, both
small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive
a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads; and that
no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the

The Mark of the Beast

[440-447]

241

name of the beast, or the number of his name.” Revelation
13:16, 17. This is the mark concerning which the third
angel utters his warning. It is the mark of the first beast,
or the papacy, and is therefore to be sought among the distinguishing characteristics of that power. The prophet Daniel
declared that the Roman Church, symbolized by the little
horn, was to think to change times and laws (Daniel 7:25),
while Paul styled it the man of sin (2 Thessalonians 2:3, 4),
who was to exalt himself above God. Only by changing
God’s law could the papacy exalt itself above God; whoever should understandingly keep the law as thus
changed would be giving supreme honor to that power
by which the change was made. Such an act of obedience
to papal laws would be a mark of allegiance to the pope
in the place of God.
The papacy has attempted to change the law of God.
The second commandment, forbidding image worship, has
been dropped from the law, and the fourth commandment
has been so changed as to authorize the observance of the
first instead of the seventh day as the Sabbath. But papists
urge as a reason for omitting the second commandment, that
it is unnecessary, being included in the first, and that they
are giving the law exactly as God designed it to be understood. This cannot be the change foretold by the prophet. An
intentional, deliberate change is brought to view: “He shall
think to change times and laws.” The change in the fourth
commandment exactly fulfills the prophecy. For this
change the only authority claimed is that of the church.
Here the papal power openly sets itself above God.
The claim so often put forth, that Christ changed the
Sabbath, is disproved by His own words. In His sermon
on the mount he declared: “Think not that I am come to destroy the law or the prophets; I am not come to destroy, but
to fulfill. For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth
pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law,
till all be fulfilled. Whosoever therefore shall break one of
these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall
be called the least in the kingdom of Heaven; but whosoever

242

The

Great

Controversy

shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the
kingdom of Heaven.” Matthew 5:17-19.
Roman Catholics acknowledge that the change of the
Sabbath was made by their church; and they cite this
change as evidence of the authority of the church to legislate in divine things, and declare that Protestants, by
observing the Sabbath as thus changed, are recognizing
her power. The Roman Church has not relinquished her claim
to supremacy; and when the world and the Protestant churches
accept a Sabbath of her creating, while they reject the Bible
Sabbath, they virtually admit this assumption. They may
claim the authority of apostles and Fathers for the change;
but in so doing they ignore the very principle which separates them from Rome,—that “the Bible, and the Bible only,
is the religion of Protestants.” The papist can see that they
are deceiving themselves, willingly closing their eyes to the
facts in the case. As the Sunday institution gains favor, he
rejoices, feeling assured that it will eventually bring the whole
Protestant world under the banner of Rome.
The fourth commandment, which Rome has endeavored to set aside, is the only precept of the decalogue
that points to God as the Creator of the heavens and the
earth, and thus distinguishes the true God from all false
gods. The Sabbath was instituted to commemorate the work
of creation, and thus to direct the minds of men to the true
and living God. The fact of His creative power is cited
throughout the Scriptures as proof that the God of Israel is
superior to heathen deities. Had the Sabbath always been
kept, man’s thoughts and affections would have been led to
His Maker as the object of reverence and worship, and there
would never have been an idolater, an atheist, or an infidel.
That institution which points to God as the Creator is
a sign of His rightful authority over the beings He has
made. The change of the Sabbath is the sign, or mark, of
the authority of the Romish Church. Those who, understanding the claims of the fourth commandment, choose to
observe the false in place of the true Sabbath, are thereby
paying homage to that power by which alone it is commanded.

The Mark of the Beast

[447-450]

243

The change in the fourth commandment is the change
pointed out in the prophecy, and the keeping of the counterfeit Sabbath is the reception of the mark. But Christians of past generations observed the first day, supposing that they were keeping the Bible Sabbath, and there
are in the churches of to-day many who honestly believe that
Sunday is the Sabbath of divine appointment. None of these
have received the mark of the beast. There are true Christians in every church, not excepting the Roman Catholic communion. The test upon this question does not come until
Sunday observance is enforced by law, and the world is
enlightened concerning the obligation of the true Sabbath. Not until the issue is thus plainly set before the people,
and they are brought to choose between the commandments
of God and the commandments of men, will those who continue in transgression receive the mark of the beast.
The most fearful threatening ever addressed to mortals is contained in the third angel’s message. That must
be a terrible sin which calls down the wrath of God unmingled
with mercy. Men are not to be left in darkness concerning
this important matter; the warning against this sin is to be
given to the world before the visitation of God’s judgments,
that all may know why they are to be inflicted, and have
opportunity to escape them.
In the issue of the great contest, two distinct, opposite
classes are developed. One class “worship the beast and
his image, and receive his mark,” and thus bring upon
themselves the awful judgments threatened by the third angel. The other class, in marked contrast to the world,
“keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus.”
Revelation 14:9, 12. Though the powers of earth summon
their forces to compel “all, both small and great, rich and
poor, free and bond,” to receive the mark of the beast, yet
the people of God do not receive it. The prophet of Patmos
beholds “them that had gotten the victory over the beast,
and over his image, and over his mark, and over the number
of his name, stand on the sea of glass, having the harps of
God” (Revelation 15:2), and singing the song of Moses and

The work of Sabbath reform to be accomplished in
the last days is clearly brought to view in the prophecy
of Isaiah: “Thus saith the Lord, Keep ye judgment, and do
justice; for My salvation is near to come, and My righteousness to be revealed. Blessed is the man that doeth this, and
the son of man that layeth hold on it; that keepeth the Sabbath from polluting it, and keepeth his hand from doing any
evil.” “The sons of the stranger, that join themselves to the
Lord, to serve Him, and to love the name of the Lord, to be
His servants, every one that keepeth the Sabbath from polluting it, and taketh hold of My covenant; even them will I
bring to My holy mountain, and make them joyful in My
house of prayer.” Isaiah 56:1, 2, 6, 7.
These words apply in the Christian age, as is shown
by the context: “The Lord God which gathereth the outcasts
of Israel saith, Yet will I gather others to him, beside those
that are gathered unto him.” Isaiah 56:8. Here is foreshadowed the gathering in of the Gentiles by the gospel. And
upon those who then honor the Sabbath, a blessing is pronounced. Thus the obligation of the fourth commandment
extends past the crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension of
Christ, to the time when His servants should preach to all
nations the message of glad tidings.
The Lord commands by the same prophet, “Bind up
the testimony, seal the law among My disciples.” Isaiah
8:16. The seal of God’s law is found in the fourth commandment. This only, of all the ten, brings to view both the

The Mark of the Beast

name and the title of the Lawgiver. It declares Him to be the
Creator of the heavens and the earth, and thus shows His
claim to reverence and worship above all others. Aside from
this precept, there is nothing in the decalogue to show by
whose authority the law is given. When the Sabbath was
changed by the papal power, the seal was taken from the
law. The disciples of Jesus are called upon to restore it, by
exalting the Sabbath of the fourth commandment to its rightful position as the Creator’s memorial and the sign of His
authority.
“To the law and to the testimony.” While conflicting
doctrines and theories abound, the law of God is the one
unerring standard to which all opinions, doctrines, and
theories are to be brought. Says the prophet, “If they
speak not according to this word, it is because there is
no light in them.” Isaiah 8:20.
Again, the command is given, “Cry aloud, spare not, lift
up thy voice like a trumpet, and show My people their transgression, and the house of Jacob their sins.” It is not the
wicked world, but those whom the Lord designates as “My
people,” that are to be reproved for their transgressions. He
declares further, “Yet they seek me daily, and delight to know
My ways, as a nation that did righteousness, and forsook not
the ordinance of their God.” Isaiah 58:1, 2. Here is brought
to view a class who think themselves righteous, and appear
to manifest great interest in the service of God; but the stern
and solemn rebuke of the Searcher of hearts proves them to
be trampling upon the divine precepts.
The prophet thus points out the ordinance which has
been forsaken: “Thou shalt raise up the foundations of many
generations; and thou shalt be called, The repairer of the
breach, the restorer of paths to dwell in. If thou turn away
thy foot from the Sabbath, from doing thy pleasure on
My holy day; and call the Sabbath a delight, the holy of
the Lord, honorable; and shalt honor Him, not doing thine
own ways, nor finding thine own pleasure, nor speaking thine
own words; then shalt thou delight thyself in the Lord.” Isaiah
58:12, 14. This prophecy also applies in our time. The

250

breach was made in the law of God when the Sabbath
was changed by the Romish power. But the time has come
for that divine institution to be restored. The breach is
to be repaired, and the foundation of many generations
to be raised up.
With peculiar fitness may the Sabbath be called the foundation of many generations. Hallowed by the Creator’s rest
and blessing, it was kept by Adam in his innocence in holy
Eden; by Adam, fallen yet repentant, when he was driven
from his happy estate. It was kept by all the patriarchs, from
Abel to righteous Noah, to Abraham, to Jacob. When the
chosen people were in bondage in Egypt, many, in the midst
of prevailing idolatry, lost their knowledge of God’s law;
but when the Lord delivered Israel, He proclaimed His law
in awful grandeur to the assembled multitude, that they might
know His will, and fear and obey Him forever.
From that day to the present, the knowledge of God’s law
has been preserved in the earth, and the Sabbath of the fourth
commandment has been kept. Though the man of sin succeeded in trampling the Sabbath under foot, yet even in
the period of his supremacy there were, hidden in secret
places, faithful souls who honored the Creator’s rest-day.
Since the Reformation, there have been in every generation witnesses for God to uphold the standard of the
ancient Sabbath. Though often in the midst of reproach
and persecution, a constant testimony has been borne to this
truth. Since 1844, in fulfillment of the prophecy of the third
angel’s message, the attention of the world has been called
to the true Sabbath, and a constantly increasing number are
returning to the observance of God’s holy day.

Those who first received the third angel’s message saw
the beauty and harmony of the system of truth that
opened to their understanding, they desired that the light
which appeared to them so precious might be imparted
to all Christians; and they could not but believe that it
would be joyfully accepted. But truths that would place
them at variance with the world were not welcome to
many who claimed to be followers of Christ. Obedience
to the fourth commandment required a sacrifice from which
the majority, even of Adventists, drew back.
As the claims of the Sabbath were presented, many who
had endured reproach and persecution for the Advent faith,
began to reason from the worldling’s standpoint. Said they:
“We have always kept Sunday, our fathers kept it, and
many good and pious men have died happy while keeping it. If they were right, so are we. The keeping of this
new Sabbath would throw us out of harmony with the world,
and we would have no influence over them. What can a little
company keeping the seventh day hope to accomplish against

252

The

Great

Controversy

all the world who are keeping Sunday?” It was by similar
arguments that the Jews endeavored to justify their rejection
of Christ. Their fathers had been accepted of God in presenting the sacrificial offerings, and why could not the children find salvation in pursuing the same course? So, in the
time of Luther, papists reasoned that true Christians had died
in the Catholic faith, and therefore that religion was sufficient for salvation. Such reasoning would prove an effectual
barrier to all advancement in religious faith or practice.
Many urged that Sunday-keeping had been an established doctrine and a wide-spread custom of the church
for many centuries. Against this argument it was shown
that the Sabbath and its observance were more ancient
and wide-spread, even as old as the world itself, and bearing the sanction both of angels and of God. When the foundations of the earth were laid, when the morning stars sang
together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy, then was
laid the foundation of the Sabbath. Job 38:6, 7; Genesis 2:13. Well may this institution demand our reverence: it was
ordained by no human authority, and rests on no human
tradition; it was established by the Ancient of days, and
commanded by His eternal word.
As the attention of the people was called to the subject of
Sabbath reform, popular ministers perverted the word of God,
placing such interpretations upon its testimony as would best
quiet inquiring minds. And those who did not search the
Scriptures for themselves were content to accept the ministers’ conclusions. By argument, sophistry, the traditions
of the Fathers, and the authority of the church, opposers
endeavored to overthrow the truth. Its advocates were
driven to their Bibles to defend the validity of the fourth
commandment. Humble men, armed with the word of truth
alone, met and withstood the attacks of men of learning. With
surprise and anger, popular ministers found their eloquent
sophistry powerless against the simple, straightforward reasoning of men who had but little of the learning of the schools.
In the absence of Scripture testimony in their favor, many
with unwearying persistency inquired,—forgetting how the

Third

Angel’s

Message

Rejected

[454-457]

253

same reasoning had been employed against Christ and His
apostles,—“Why do not our great men understand this
Sabbath question? But few believe as you do, and even
these are uneducated persons. It cannot be that you are
right, and that all the men of learning in the world are
wrong.”
To refute such arguments it was needful only to cite
the teachings of the Scriptures and the history of the
Lord’s dealings with His people in all ages. God works
through those who hear and obey His voice, those who will,
if need be, speak unpalatable truths, those who do not fear to
reprove popular sins. The reason why He does not oftener
choose men of learning and high position is, that they trust
to their creeds, theories, and theological systems, and feel no
need to be taught of God. Only those who have a personal
connection with the Source of wisdom are able to understand or explain the Scriptures. Men who have little of the
learning of the schools are called to declare the truth,
not because they are unlearned, but because they are not
too self-sufficient to be taught of God. They learn in the
school of Christ, and their humility and obedience make them
great. In committing to them a knowledge of His truth, God
confers upon them an honor, in comparison with which earthly
honor and human greatness sink into insignificance.
As the majority of Adventists rejected the truths concerning the sanctuary and the law of God, many also
renounced their faith in the Advent movement, and
adopted unsound and conflicting views of the prophecies which applied to that work. Some were led into the
error of repeated time-setting. The light of the third message would have shown them that no prophetic period
extends to the coming of Christ; that the exact time of
His coming is not foretold. But, turning from the light, they
continued to set time after time for the Lord to come, and as
often were disappointed.
When the Thessalonian church received erroneous views
concerning the coming of Christ, the apostle Paul counseled
them to carefully test their hopes and anticipations by the

254

The

Great

Controversy

word of God. He cited them to prophecies revealing the events
to take place before Christ should come, and showed that
they had no ground to expect Him in their day. “Let no man
deceive you by any means,” are his words of warning. Should
they indulge expectations that were not sanctioned by the
Scriptures, they would be led to a mistaken course of action;
disappointment would expose them to the derision of unbelievers, and they would be in danger of yielding to discouragement, and would be tempted to doubt the truths essential
for their salvation. The apostle’s admonition to the Thessalonians contains an important lesson for those who live in
the last days. Many Adventists have felt that unless they could
fix their faith upon a definite time for the Lord’s coming,
they could not be zealous and diligent in the work of preparation. But as their hopes are again and again excited, only
to be destroyed, their faith receives such a shock that it becomes well-nigh impossible for them to be impressed by the
great truths of prophecy. The more frequently a definite time
is set for the second advent, and the more widely it is taught,
the better it suits the purposes of Satan. After the time has
passed, he excites ridicule and contempt of its advocates,
and thus casts reproach upon the true time movement of 1843
and 1844. Those who persist in this error will at last fix
upon a date too far in the future for the coming of Christ.
Thus they will be led to rest in a false security, and many will
not be undeceived until it is too late.
The history of ancient Israel is a striking illustration
of the past experience of the Adventist body. God led
His people in the Advent movement, even as He led the
children of Israel from Egypt. In the great disappointment
their faith was tested as was that of the Hebrews at the Red
Sea. Had they still trusted to the guiding hand that had been
with them in their past experience, they would have seen of
the salvation of God. If all who had labored unitedly in the
work in 1844 had received the third angel’s message, and
proclaimed it in the power of the Holy Spirit, the Lord would
have wrought mightily with their efforts. A flood of light
would have been shed upon the world. Years ago the inhab-

255

itants of the earth would have been warned, the closing work
completed, and Christ would have come for the redemption
of His people.
It was not the will of God that Israel should wander forty
years in the wilderness; He desired to lead them directly to
the land of Canaan, and establish them there, a holy, happy
people. But “they could not enter in because of unbelief.”
Hebrews 3:19. Because of their backsliding and apostasy,
they perished in the desert, and others were raised up to enter the promised land. In like manner, it was not the will of
God that the coming of Christ should be so long delayed,
and His people should remain so many years in this world
of sin and sorrow. But unbelief separated them from God.
As they refused to do the work which He had appointed
them, others were raised up to proclaim the message. In
mercy to the world, Jesus delays His coming, that sinners
may have an opportunity to hear the warning, and find in
him a shelter before the wrath of God shall be poured out.
Now, as in former ages, the presentation of a truth
that reproves the errors and sins of the times, will call
forth a storm of opposition. “Every one that doeth evil
hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds
should be reproved.” John 3:20. Those who cannot sustain
their position by the Scriptures are stubbornly determined
that it shall be sustained at all hazards, and with a malicious
spirit they attack the character and motives of those who
stand in defense of unpopular truth. Though very unbelieving in regard to the sure word of prophecy, they manifest the
utmost credulity in accepting anything detrimental to the
Christian integrity of those who dare to reprove fashionable
sins. This spirit will increase more and more as we near the
close of time.
And what is our duty in view of this? Shall we conclude
that the truth ought not to be presented, since its effect is so
often to arouse men to evade or resist its claims?—No; we
have no more reason for withholding the testimony of God’s
word because it excites opposition than had Martin Luther.
Luther declared himself to have been urged on, compelled

by the Spirit of God, to battle against the evils of his time;
and in the same manner must those labor who still carry forward the work of reform. To the servants of God at this
time is the command addressed, “Lift up thy voice like a
trumpet, and show My people their transgression, and
the house of Jacob their sins.”
The true followers of Christ do not wait for truth to
become popular. Being convinced of their duty, they deliberately accept the cross, and thus remove the greatest obstacle to the reception of truth,—the only argument which
its advocates have never been able to refute. It is weak, inefficient world-servers that think it praiseworthy to have no
principle in religious things. We should choose the right
because it is right, and leave consequences with God. To
men of principle, faith, and daring, is the world indebted
for its great reforms. By such men must the work of reform for this time be carried forward.
Thus saith the Lord: “Hearken unto Me, ye that know
righteousness, the people in whose heart is My law; fear ye
not the reproach of men, neither be ye afraid of their revilings.
For the moth shall eat them up like a garment, and the worm
shall eat them like wool; but My righteousness shall be forever, and My salvation from generation to generation.” Isaiah
51:7, 8.
CHAPTER SUPPLEMENT
Y CY
CLE
SUPPLEMENT:: THE WEEKL
WEEKLY
CYCLE

The writings of historians, the records of chronographers, the languages of earth,
the calendars of time, and the existence of the Jewish race—all testify to the fact that
the weekly cycle on our calendars today is the same as in earlier centuries—going
back to the time of Christ, to Moses, and beyond.
In the beginning, God gave us the weekly seven-day cycle, with the Sabbath as
the last day. That pattern has never changed. The seventh day of the week today is
the true, Bible Sabbath. Our seventh day is the Sabbath which Jesus kept; it is the
Sabbath in the time of Moses when the Ten Commandments were written down.
Historians and scientists all agree that this is true.
If there had been any change in the weekly cycle, between the time of Creation
and the time of Moses, a correction would have been made when the Ten Commandments were given to the Hebrews. From that time, on down to the present, there have
always been Jews to testify as to the true Sabbath. It is the same seventh day of the
week which is on our calendars. While all the other ancient races are now inter-

[459-460]

257

mingled, the Jews have been kept separate so they could testify to the fact that our
seventh day is the Bible Sabbath!
The yearly cycle has been changed. In 1582, the length of the year was changed
to include the leap year. This changeover resulted in October 1582 having only 21
days! But each week remained the same seven days in length. Thursday, October 4,
was followed by Friday, October 15. God has divinely protected the weekly cycle
down through the ages. If He had not done this, it would be impossible to keep the
Sabbath holy, as He has commanded. But, because He has, we have no excuse not
to. The seventh day is a holy day; made holy by the command of God. All calendars
agree: the seventh day is the Sabbath. Sunday is the first day; the day called “Saturday” in the English langauge is the Sabbath.
However, in 108 of the 160 languages of mankind, the seventh day is called “the
Sabbath”! Did you know that? Dr. William Mead Jones of London prepared a chart
proving this. (A copy of this chart can be obtained free of charge from the publisher
of this book: ask for “The Chart of the Week” [BS–28-29]. English is one of the few
major languages in which the seventh day is not called “the Sabbath.”
Here are ten examples: Hebrew: Shabbath / Greek: Sabbaton / Latin: Sabbatum /
Arabic: Assabit / Persian: Shambin / Russian: Subbota / Hindustani: Shamba / French:
Samedi / Italian: Sabbato / Spanish: Sabado.
“By calculating the eclipses, it can be proven that no time has been lost and the
creation days were seven, divided into 24 hours each.”—Dr. Hinkley, The Watchman,
July 1926 [Hinkley was a well-known astronomer].
“The human race never lost the septenary [seven day] sequence of week days
and that the Sabbath of these latter times comes down to us from Adam, though the
ages, without a single lapse.”—Dr. Totten, professor of astronomy at Yale University.
“Seven has been the ancient and honored number among the nations of the
earth. They have measured their time by weeks from the beginning. The origin of
this was the Sabbath of God, as Moses has given the reasons for it in his writings.”—Dr. Lyman Coleman.
“There has been no change in our calendar in past centuries that has affected in
any way the cycle of the week.”—James Robertson, Director American Ephemeris,
Navy Department, U.S. Naval Observatory, Washington, D.C., March 12, 1932.
“It can be said with assurance that not a day has been lost since Creation, and all
the calendar changes notwithstanding, there has been no break in the weekly cycle.”—
Dr. Frank Jeffries, Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society and Research Director of
the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, England.
It is remarkable how complete is the Biblical and historical evidence corroborating the fact that the Bible Sabbath was given to us by the God of heaven. Let us keep
the Sabbath that Jesus kept! He worshiped on the Bible Sabbath, and never told us to
stop keeping it. No one else in the Bible said to either. The seventh day is the Sabbath, for God never changed it.

“Sunday is a Catholic institution, and its claim to observance can be

there is not a single passage that warrants the transfer of weekly public
worship from the last day of the week to the first.”—Catholic Press, Sydney,
Australia, August, 1900.
“Protestantism, in discarding the authority of the [Roman Catholic]
Church, has no good reason for its Sunday theory, and ought logically to
keep Saturday as the Sabbath.”—John Gilmary Shea, in the American
Catholic Quarterly Review, January 1883.
“It is well to remind the Presbyterians, Baptists, Methodists, and all
other Christians that the Bible does not support them anywhere in their
observance of Sunday. Sunday is an institution of the Roman Catholic
Church, and those who observe the day observe a commandment of the
Catholic Church.”—Priest Brady, in an address, reported in the Elizabeth,
N.J. News of March 18, 1903.
“Ques.—Have you any other way of proving that the [Catholic] Church
has power to institute festivals of precept [to command holy days]?
“Ans.—Had she not such power, she could not have done that in which
all modern religionists agree with her: She could not have substituted the
observance of Sunday, the first day of the week, for the observance of
Saturday, the seventh day, a change for which there is no Scriptural authority.”—Stephen Keenan, Doctrinal Catechism, p. 176.
“Reason and common sense demand the acceptance of one or the
other of these two alternatives: either Protestantism and the keeping holy
of Saturday or Catholicity and the keeping holy of Sunday. Compromise is
impossible.”—The Catholic Mirror, December 23, 1893.
“God simply gave His [Catholic] Church the power to set aside whatever day or days she would deem suitable as Holy Days. The Church chose
Sunday, the first day of the week, and in the course of time added other
days, as holy days.”—Vincent J. Kelly, Forbidden Sunday and Feast-Day
Occupations, p. 2.
“Protestants . . accept Sunday rather than Saturday as the day for public worship after the Catholic Church made the change . . But the Protestant

“It was the Catholic Church which, by the authority of Jesus Christ, has

“We observe Sunday instead of Saturday because the Catholic Church
transferred the solemnity from Saturday to Sunday.”—Peter Geiermann,

“We Catholics, then, have precisely the same authority for keeping Sunday holy instead of Saturday as we have for every other article of our creed,
namely, the authority of the Church . . whereas you who are Protestants
have really no authority for it whatever; for there is no authority for it [Sunday sacredness] in the Bible, and you will not allow that there can be authority for it anywhere else.”—The Brotherhood of St. Paul, “The Clifton

“The Church changed the observance of the Sabbath to Sunday by right
of the divine, infallible authority given to her by her founder, Jesus Christ.

BAPTIST:: “To me it seems unaccountable that Jesus, during three years’
discussion with His disciples, often conversing upon the Sabbath question, discussing it in some of its various aspects, freeing it from its false
[Jewish traditional] glosses, never alluded to any transference of the day;
also, no such thing was intimated. Nor, so far as we know, did the Spirit,
which was given to bring to their remembrance all things whatsoever that
He had said unto them, deal with this question. Nor yet did the inspired
apostles, in preaching the gospel, founding churches, counseling and instructing those founded, discuss or approach the subject.
“Of course I quite well know that Sunday did come into use in early
Christian history as a religious day, as we learn from the Christian Fathers
and other sources. But what a pity that it comes branded with the mark of
paganism, and christened with the name of the sun god, then adopted and
sanctified by the Papal apostasy, and bequeathed as a sacred legacy to
Protestantism.”—Dr. E.T. Hiscox, report of his sermon at the Baptist
Minister’s Convention, New York Examiner, November 16, 1893.

———————————————————————

The character and tendency of modern revivals has
awakened no little anxiety in thoughtful minds among
all denominations. Many of the revivals which have occurred during the last forty years have given no evidence
of the work of the Spirit of God. The light which flames
up for a time, soon dies out, leaving the darkness more dense
than before. Popular revivals are too often carried by appeals to the imagination, by exciting the emotions, by pandering to the love for what is new and startling. Converts
thus gained have no more desire to listen to Bible truths, no
more interest in the testimony of prophets and apostles, than
has the novel-reader. Unless a religious service has something of a sensational character, it has no attractions for them.
A message which appeals to unimpassioned reason, awakens no response. The plain warnings of God’s word, relating
directly to their eternal interests, fall as upon the ears of the
dead.
The converts are not renewed in heart or changed in
character. They do not renounce their pride and love of
the world. They are no more willing to deny self, to take up
the cross, and follow the meek and lowly Jesus, than before

their conversion. In a genuine revival, when the Spirit of God
convicts the conscience, the earnest, anxious inquiry will be
heard, “What must I do to be saved?” And this not merely
for a day. With every truly converted soul the relation to God
and to eternal things will be the great topic of life. But where,
in the popular churches of to-day, is the deep conviction of
sin? where is the spirit of consecration to God? The spirit
that controls the world rules in the church. Religion has become the sport of infidels and skeptics because so many
who bear its name are ignorant of its principles. The
power of godliness has well-nigh departed from the
churches. Heart union with Christ is a rare thing now.
The majority of church-members know no tie but that which
joins them to an organized body of professed Christians. Love
of pleasure and thirst for excitement are everywhere prevalent. Picnics, church theatricals, church fairs, fine houses,
personal display, have banished thoughts of God. Lands and
goods and worldly occupations engross the mind, and things
of eternal interest receive hardly a passing notice.
Pleasure-lovers may have their names upon the
church-records, they may stand high as worldly-wise
men; but they have no connection with Christ of Calvary. The apostle Paul describes a class who are “lovers of
pleasures more than lovers of God; having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof.” Concerning them he
says, “From such turn away.” 2 Timothy 3:4, 5. Be not deceived by them, do not imitate their practices.
Notwithstanding the wide-spread declension of faith and
piety in the churches, the Lord still has honest children among
them; and before His judgments shall be visited upon the
earth, many ministers and lay-members will separate
from these bodies, and gladly receive the special truths
for this time. The enemy of souls desires to hinder this
work, and before the time shall come for such a movement, he will arouse what appears to be great religious
interest in the churches. They will exult that God is working marvelously for them, when the work is that of another
spirit. Under a religious guise, Satan will spread his influ-

ence over the land. He hopes to deceive many by leading
them to think that God is still with the churches.
Many of the revivals which have occurred since 1844,
in the churches that have rejected the Advent truth, are
similar in character to those more extensive movements
to be witnessed in the future. The excitement manifested
is well adapted to mislead the unwary; yet none need be deceived. In the light of God’s word it is not difficult to determine the nature of these religious movements. The history
of God’s dealings with His people in the past testifies that
His Spirit is not poured out upon those who neglect or oppose the warnings sent them by His servants. And by the
rule which Christ Himself has given, “Ye shall know them
by their fruits,” it is evident that these movements are not
the work of the Spirit of God.
The scriptural doctrine of conversion has been almost
wholly lost sight of. Christ declared to Nicodemus, “Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.”
The heart must be renewed by divine grace, man must have
a new life from above, or his profession of godliness will
avail nothing.
The apostle Paul, in relating his experience, presents an
important truth concerning the work to be wrought in conversion. He says, “I was alive without the law once,”—he
felt no condemnation; “but when the commandment came,”
when the law of God was urged upon his conscience, “sin
revived, and I died.” Romans 7:9. Then he saw himself a
sinner, condemned by the divine law. Mark, it was Paul, and
not the law, that died. He says, further, “I had not known sin,
but by the law; for I had not known lust, except the law had
said, Thou shalt not covet.” Romans 7:7. “The commandment which was ordained to life, I found to be unto death.”
Romans 7:10. The law which promised life to the obedient,
pronounced death upon the transgressor. “Wherefore,” he
says, “the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just,
and good.” Romans 7:12.
How wide the contrast between these words of Paul
and those that come from many of the pulpits of to-day.

The people are taught that obedience to God’s law is not
necessary to salvation; that they have only to believe in
Jesus, and they are safe. Without the law, men have no
conviction of sin, and feel no need of repentance. Not seeing
their lost condition as violators of God’s law, they do not
feel their need of the atoning blood of Christ as their only
hope of salvation.
The law of God is an agent in every genuine conversion. There can be no true repentance without conviction of sin. The Scriptures declare that “sin is the transgression of the law” (1 John 3:4), and that “by the law is
the knowledge of sin.” Romans 3:20. In order to see his
guilt, the sinner must test his character by God’s great
standard of righteousness. To discover his defects, he must
look into the mirror of the divine statutes. But while the law
reveals his sins, it provides no remedy. The gospel of Christ
alone can offer pardon. In order to stand forgiven, the sinner
must exercise repentance toward God, whose law has been
transgressed, and faith in Christ, His atoning sacrifice. Without true repentance, there can be no true conversion. Many
are deceived here, and too often their entire experience proves
to be a deception. This is why so many who are joined to the
church have never been joined to Christ.
“The carnal mind is enmity against God; for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.” Romans 8:7.
In the new birth, the heart is renewed by divine grace,
and brought into harmony with God as it is brought into
subjection to His law. When this mighty change has taken
place in the sinner, he has passed from death unto life,
from sin unto holiness, from transgression and rebellion
to obedience and loyalty. The old life of alienation from
God has ended; the new life of reconciliation, of faith and
love, has begun. Then will “the righteousness of the law”
“be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh, but after the
Spirit.” Romans 8:4.
The doctrine of sanctification, or perfect holiness,
which fills a prominent place in some of the religious
movements of the day, is among the causes that have ren-

266

The

Great

Controversy

dered modern revivals so ineffectual. True sanctification
is a Bible doctrine. The apostle Paul declared to the
Thessalonian church, “This is the will of God, even your
sanctification.” 1 Thessalonians 4:3. And again he prayed,
“The very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God
your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless
unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.” 1 Thessalonians
5:23. But the sanctification now so widely advocated is not
that brought to view in the Scriptures. It is false in theory,
and dangerous in its practical results.
Its advocates teach that the law of God is a grievous
yoke, and that by faith in Christ, men are released from
all obligation to keep His Father’s commandments. Bible
sanctification is a conformity to the will of God, attained
by rendering obedience to His law, through faith in His
Son. Our Saviour prayed for His disciples, “Sanctify them
through thy truth; thy word is truth.” John 17:17. There is
no genuine sanctification except through obedience to the
truth; and the psalmist declares, “Thy law is the truth.” Psalm
119:142. The law of God is the only standard of moral perfection. That law was exemplified in the life of Christ. He
says, “I have kept my Father’s commandments.” John 15:10.
And the apostle John affirms, “He that saith He abideth in
Him ought himself also so to walk, even as He walked.” And
again, “This is the love of God, that we keep His commandments.” 1 John 2:6; 5:3. Those who love God will love His
commandments also. The truly sanctified heart is in harmony
with the divine precepts; for they are “holy, and just, and
good.”
It is only when the law of God is set aside, and men
have no standard of right, no means to detect sin, that
erring mortals can claim perfect holiness. But let none
deceive themselves with the belief that God will accept
and bless them while they are willfully violating one of
His requirements. The commission of a known sin silences
the witnessing voice of the Spirit, and separates the soul from
God. Jesus cannot abide in the heart that disregards the divine law. God will honor those only who honor Him. “Who-

Modern

als

vivals

[469-470]

267

soever committeth sin transgresseth also the law; for sin is
the transgression of the law.” “Whosoever abideth in Him
sinneth not; whosoever sinneth [transgresseth the law] hath
not seen Him, neither known Him.” 1 John 3:4, 6. Though
John in his epistles treats so fully upon love, yet he does not
hesitate to reveal the true character of that class who claim
to be sanctified while living in transgression of the law of
God: “He that saith, I know Him, and keepeth not His commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in Him.” 1 John
2:4.
Sanctification is believed by many to be instantaneously accomplished. “Only believe,” say they, “and the
blessing is yours.” No further effort on the part of the
receiver is supposed to be required. But the Bible teaches
that sanctification is progressive. The Christian will feel
the promptings of sin, but he will keep up a constant
warfare against it. Here is where Christ’s help is needed.
Human weakness becomes united to divine strength, and faith
exclaims, “Thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory
through our Lord Jesus Christ.” 1 Corinthians 15:57. Paul
exhorts his brethren, “Work out your own salvation with fear
and trembling;” (Philippians 2:12) and concerning himself
he declares, “I press toward the mark for the prize of the
high calling of God in Christ Jesus.” Philippians 3:14. The
successive steps in the attainment of Bible sanctification are
set before us in the words of Peter: “Giving all diligence,
add to your faith, virtue; and to virtue, knowledge; and to
knowledge, temperance; and to temperance, patience; and to
patience, godliness; and to godliness, brotherly kindness; and
to brotherly kindness, charity.” “Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your calling and election sure;
for if ye do these things, ye shall never fall.” 2 Peter 1:5-7,
10. This is a daily work, continuing as long as life shall last.
Spurious sanctification carries with it a boastful, selfrighteous spirit which is foreign to the religion of the
Bible. Meekness and humility are the fruits of the Spirit.
The prophet Daniel was an example of true sanctification.
His long life was filled up with noble service for his Master.

268

The

Great

Controversy

He was a man “greatly beloved” (Daniel 10:11) of Heaven,
and was granted such honors as have rarely been vouchsafed
to mortals. Yet his purity of character and unwavering fidelity were equaled only by his humility and contrition. Instead
of claiming to be pure and holy, this honored prophet identified himself with the really sinful of Israel, as he pleaded
before God in behalf of his people: “We do not present our
supplications before thee for our righteousness, but for Thy
great mercies.” “We have sinned, we have done wickedly.”
And “for our sins, and for the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and Thy people are become a reproach.” He declares, “I
was speaking, and praying, and confessing my sin and the
sin of My people.” Daniel 9:18, 15, 16, 20. And when at a
later time the Son of God appeared in answer to his prayers
to give him instruction, he declares, “My comeliness was
turned in me into corruption, and I retained no strength.”
Daniel 10:8.
Those who are truly seeking to perfect Christian character will never indulge the thought that they are sinless.
The more their minds dwell upon the character of Christ,
and the nearer they approach to His divine image, the more
clearly will they discern its spotless perfection, and the more
deeply will they feel their own weakness and defects. Those
who claim to be without sin, give evidence that they are far
from holy. It is because they have no true knowledge of Christ
that they can look upon themselves as reflecting His image.
The greater the distance between them and their Saviour, the
more righteous they appear in their own eyes.
The sanctification set forth in the Scriptures embraces
the entire being,—spirit, soul, and body. Paul prayed for
the Thessalonians, that their “whole spirit and soul and body
be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus
Christ.” Again he writes to believers, “I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your
bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God.” Romans 12:1. The Jews were commanded to offer in sacrifice
to God only such animals as were free from disease or blemish. So Christians are required to preserve all their powers in

Modern

als

vivals

[470-475]

269

the best possible condition for the Lord’s service. Says Peter, “Abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul.”
1 Peter 2:11. The word of God will make but a feeble impression upon those whose faculties are benumbed by any
sinful gratification. The heart cannot preserve consecration
to God while the animal appetites and passions are indulged
at the expense of health and life. Paul writes to the Corinthians, “Let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the
flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.” 2
Corinthians 7:1. And with the fruits of the Spirit—“love,
joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness,”—he classes temperance. Galatians 5:22, 23.
Notwithstanding these inspired declarations, how
many professed Christians are enfeebling their powers
in the pursuit of gain or the worship of fashion; how many
are debasing their godlike manhood by gluttony, by winedrinking, by forbidden pleasure. And the church, instead
of rebuking, too often encourages the evil by appealing to
appetite, to desire for gain, or love of pleasure, to replenish
her treasury, which love for Christ is too feeble to supply.
Were Jesus to enter the churches of to-day, and behold the
feasting and unholy traffic there conducted in the name of
religion, would He not drive out those desecrators, as He
banished the money-changers from the temple?
The apostle James declares that the wisdom from
above is “first pure.” Had he encountered those who take
the precious name of Jesus upon lips defiled by tobacco, those
whose breath and person are contaminated by its foul odor,
and who pollute the air of heaven and force all about them to
inhale the poison,—had the apostle come in contact with a
practice so opposed to the purity of the gospel, would he not
have denounced it as “earthly, sensual, devilish”? Slaves of
tobacco, claiming the blessing of entire sanctification, talk
of their hope of Heaven; but God’s word plainly declares
that “there shall in no wise enter into it anything that defileth.”
Revelation 21:27.
“Know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy
Ghost, which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not

270

The

Great

Controversy

your own? For ye are bought with a price; therefore glorify
God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God’s.” 1
Corinthians 6:19, 20. He whose body is the temple of the
Holy Spirit will not be enslaved by a pernicious habit.
His powers belong to Christ, who has bought him with
the price of blood. His property is the Lord’s. How could
he be guiltless in squandering this intrusted capital? Professed Christians yearly expend an immense sum upon useless and pernicious indulgences, while souls are perishing
for the word of life. God is robbed in tithes and offerings,
while they offer upon the altar of destroying lust more than
they give to relieve the poor or for the support of the gospel.
If all who profess to be followers of Christ were truly sanctified, every channel of needless expense would be turned
into the Lord’s treasury, and Christians would set an example
of temperance, self-denial, and self-sacrifice. Then they would
be the light of the world.
The world is given up to self-indulgence. The lust of
the flesh, the lust of the eye, and the pride of life, control
the masses of the people. But Christ’s followers have a
holier calling. “Come out from among them, and be ye
separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing;
and I will receive you, and will be a Father unto you, and ye
shall be My sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.” 2
Corinthians 6:17, 18.
It is the privilege and the duty of every Christian to
maintain a close union with Christ, and to have a rich
experience in the things of God. Then his life will be fruitful in good works. When we read the lives of men who have
been eminent for their piety, we often regard their experiences and attainments as beyond our reach. But this is not
the case. Said Christ: “Herein is my Father glorified, that ye
bear much fruit.” “As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself,
except it abide in the vine, no more can ye, except ye abide
in me.” “He that abideth in Me, and I in him, the same
bringeth forth much fruit.” John 15:8, 4, 5. The prophets
and apostles did not perfect Christian character by a miracle.
They used the means which God had placed within their

Modern

als

vivals

[475-478]

271

reach, and all who will put forth a like effort will secure a
like result.
Paul addressed his Corinthian brethren as “them that
are sanctified in Christ Jesus;” and he thanked God that
in everything they were enriched by Him, “in all utterance and in all knowledge,” so that they came behind in
no gift. 1 Corinthians 1:2, 5, 7. In his epistle to the Colossians
he set forth the glorious privileges granted to the children of
God. Said the apostle: We “do not cease to pray for you, and
to desire that ye might be filled with the knowledge of His
will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding; that ye might
walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing, being fruitful in
every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God;
strengthened with all might, according to His glorious power,
unto all patience and long-suffering with joyfulness.”
Colossians 1:9-11. Such are the fruits of Bible sanctification.
In setting aside the claims of the law of God, the church
has lost sight of the blessings of the gospel. Bible conversion and sanctification,—a radical change of heart and
transformation of character,—is the great need of the
churches of to-day. Revivals in which men become members of the church without real conviction of sin, without
repentance, and without acknowledging the claims of the
law of God, are a cause of weakness to the church, and
an occasion of stumbling to the world.

How urgent it is that we learn all we can about this great day—

“I beheld,” says the prophet Daniel, “till the thrones
were cast down, and the Ancient of days did sit, whose
garment was white as snow, and the hair of His head like
the pure wool; His throne was like the fiery flame, and
His wheels as burning fire. A fiery stream issued and
came forth from before him; thousand thousands ministered unto Him, and ten thousand times ten thousand
stood before Him; the Judgment was set, and the books
were opened.” “And, behold, one like the Son of man came
with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days,
and they brought Him near before Him. And there was given
Him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all people,
nations, and languages should serve Him; His dominion is
an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away.” Daniel
7:9, 10, 13, 14.
Thus was presented to the prophet’s vision the opening of the investigative Judgment. The coming of Christ
here described is not His second coming to the earth. He
comes to the Ancient of days in Heaven to receive dominion,

Investigative

Judgment

[479-483]

273

and glory, and a kingdom, which will be given Him at the
close of His mediatorial work. It is this coming, and not His
second advent to the earth, that was foretold in prophecy to
take place at the termination of the 2300 days, in 1844. Attended by a cloud of heavenly angels, our great High Priest
enters the holy of holies, and there appears in the presence
of God to engage in the last acts of His ministration in behalf of man,—to perform the work of investigative Judgment, and to make an atonement for all who are shown to be
entitled to its benefits.
“The dead were judged,” says John, “out of those
things which were written in the books, according to their
works.” Revelation 20:12. Angels of God have kept a faithful record of the lives of all, and they are to be judged according to their deeds. In view of this Judgment, Peter exhorted the men of Israel: “Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of
refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord; and He
shall send Jesus,” “whom the heaven must receive until the
times of restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by
the mouth of all His holy prophets since the world began.”
Acts 3:19-21.
Christ Himself declares: “He that overcometh, the
same shall be clothed in white raiment; and I will not
blot out his name out of the book of life, but I will confess
his name before My Father, and before His angels.” Revelation 3:5. Again He said to His disciples: “Whosoever therefore shall confess Me before men, him will I confess also
before my Father which is in Heaven. But whosoever shall
deny Me before men, him will I also deny before My Father
which is in Heaven.” Matthew 10:32, 33.
The lives of all who have believed on Jesus pass in
solemn review before God. Beginning with those who first
lived upon the earth, our Advocate examines the cases
of each successive generation, and closes with the living.
Every name is mentioned, every case closely investigated.
Names are accepted, names rejected. From age to age, all
who have truly repented of sin, and by faith claimed the blood

274

The

of Christ as their atoning sacrifice, have had pardon written
against their names in the books of Heaven, and in the closing work of Judgment their sins are blotted out, and they
themselves are accounted worthy of eternal life.
The deepest interest manifested among men in the decisions of earthly tribunals but faintly represents the interest evinced in the heavenly courts when the names
entered in the book of life come up in review before the
Judge of all the earth. The divine Intercessor presents the
plea that all who from among the fallen sons of men have
overcome through faith in His blood, be forgiven their transgressions, that they be restored to their Eden home, and
crowned as joint-heirs with Himself to the “first dominion.”
Micah 4:8. Satan, in his efforts to deceive and tempt our
race, had thought to frustrate the divine plan in man’s creation; but Christ now asks that this plan be carried into effect as if man had never fallen. He asks for His people not
only pardon and justification, full and complete, but a share
in His glory and a seat upon His throne.
While Jesus is pleading for the subjects of His grace,
Satan accuses them before God as transgressors. The
great deceiver has sought to lead them into skepticism,
to cause them to lose confidence in God, to separate from
His love, and to break His law. Now he points to their
defective characters, to their unlikeness to Christ which has
dishonored their Redeemer, to all the sins which he has
tempted them to commit, and because of these he claims them
as his subjects.
Jesus does not excuse their sins, but shows their penitence and faith, and, claiming for them forgiveness, He
lifts His wounded hands before the Father and the holy
angels, saying, “I know them by name. I have graven
them on the palms of my hands. ‘The sacrifices of God are
a broken spirit; a broken and a contrite heart, O God, Thou
wilt not despise.’” Psalm 51:17. And to the accuser of His
people He declares, “The Lord rebuke thee, O Satan; even
the Lord that hath chosen Jerusalem rebuke thee. Is not this
a brand plucked out of the fire?” Zechariah 3:2. Christ will

Investigative

275

place His own signet upon His faithful ones, that He may
present them to His Father “a glorious church, not having
spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing.” Their names stand enrolled in the book of life, and concerning them it is written,
“They shall walk with Me in white; for they are worthy.”
Those who are owned and approved of God are not
therefore recognized and honored by the world. The very
names that are taken upon the lips of Jesus as belonging to
His own sons and daughters, joint-heirs with the King of
glory, honored among the heavenly angels, are often those
that are spoken with contempt and mockery by the ungodly.
Steadfast souls whom Jesus delights to honor are for His
sake defamed, imprisoned, mobbed, hunted, and slain. God’s
people must live by faith. They must look over into the great
beyond, and choose divine honors and the recompense of
the reward above every earthly gain or preferment. While
probation continues, they must expect that the world will
know them not, “because it knew Him not.”
Great and small, high and low, rich and poor, are to be
judged “out of those things which were written in the books,
according to their works.” Day after day, passing into eternity, bears its burden of records for the books of Heaven.
Words once spoken, deeds once done, can never be recalled. Angels of God have registered both the good and
the evil. The mightiest conqueror upon the earth cannot call
back the record of even a single day. Our acts, our words,
even our most secret motives, all have their weight in deciding our destiny for weal or woe. Though they may be forgotten by us, they will bear their testimony to justify or condemn. They go before us to the Judgment.
The use made of every talent will be scrutinized. Have
we improved the capital intrusted us of God? Will the
Lord at His coming receive His own with usury? No value is
attached to the mere profession of faith in Christ; nothing is
counted as genuine but that love which is shown by works.
As the features of the countenance are reproduced with
marvelous exactness in the camera of the artist, so is the
character faithfully delineated in the books above. If

276

The

Great

Controversy

Christians were as solicitous to stand faultless in the heavenly records as they are to be represented without a blemish
in the picture, how different would their life-history appear.
Could the vail which separates the visible from the
invisible world be swept back, and the children of men
behold an angel recording every word and deed to meet
them again in the Judgment, how many words that are
daily uttered would remain unspoken; how many deeds
would remain undone. When all the details of life appear
in the books that never contain a false entry, many will find
too late that the record testifies against them. There their
hidden selfishness stands revealed. There is the record of
unfulfilled duties to their fellow-men, of forgetfulness of the
Saviour’s claims. There they will see how often were given
to Satan the time, thought, and strength that belonged to
Christ. Sad is the record which angels bear to Heaven. Intelligent beings, professed followers of Christ, are absorbed in
the acquirement of worldly possessions or the enjoyment of
earthly pleasures. Money, time, and strength are sacrificed
for display and self-indulgence; but few are the moments
devoted to prayer, to the searching of the Scriptures, to humiliation of soul and confession of sin.
Satan invents unnumbered schemes to occupy our
minds that they may not dwell upon the very work with
which we ought to be best acquainted. The arch-deceiver
hates the great truths that bring to view an atoning sacrifice
and an all-powerful Mediator. He knows that with him everything now depends on his diverting minds from Jesus and
His truth.
Those who would share the benefits of the Saviour’s
mediation should permit nothing to interfere with their
duty to perfect holiness in the fear of God. The hours heretofore given to pleasure, to display, or to gain-seeking, should
now be devoted to an earnest, prayerful study of the word of
truth. The subject of the sanctuary and the investigative Judgment should be clearly understood by the people of God. All
need a knowledge for themselves of the position and work
of their great High Priest. Otherwise, it will be impossible

Investigative

[487-489]

277

for them to exercise the faith essential at this time, or to
occupy the position which God designs them to fill.
We are to bear testimony of the great truths which
God has committed to us. The sanctuary in Heaven is
the very center of Christ’s work in behalf of men. It concerns every soul living upon the earth. It opens to our view
the plan of redemption, bringing us down to the very close
of time, and revealing the triumphant issue of the contest
between righteousness and sin. It is of the utmost importance that all who have received the light, both old and young,
should thoroughly investigate these subjects, and be able to
give an answer to every one that asketh them a reason of the
hope that is in them.
The intercession of Christ in man’s behalf in the sanctuary above is as essential to the plan of salvation as was
His death upon the cross. By His death He began that
work which after His resurrection He ascended to complete in Heaven. We must by faith enter within the vail,
“whither the forerunner is for us entered.” There the light
from the cross of Calvary is reflected. There we may gain a
clearer insight into the mysteries of redemption. The salvation of man is accomplished at an infinite expense to Heaven;
the sacrifice made is equal to the broadest demands of the
broken law of God. Jesus has opened the way to the Father’s
throne, and through His mediation the sincere desire of all
who come to Him in faith may be presented before God.
“He that covereth his sins shall not prosper; but whoso
confesseth and forsaketh them shall have mercy.” Proverbs 28:13. If those who hide and excuse their faults could
see how Satan exults over them, how he taunts Christ and
holy angels with them, they would make haste to confess
their sins and to put them away. Satan is continually seeking
to deceive the followers of Christ with his fatal sophistry
that their defective traits of character render it impossible
for them to overcome. But Jesus pleads in their behalf His
wounded hands, His bruised body; and He declares to all
who would follow Him, “My grace is sufficient for thee.”
“Take My yoke upon you, and learn of Me; for I am meek

278

The

and lowly in heart, and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For
My yoke is easy, and My burden is light.” Matthew 11:29,
30. Let none, then, regard their defects as incurable. God
will give faith and grace to overcome them.
All who would have their names retained in the book
of life, should now, in the few remaining days of their
probation, afflict their souls before God by sorrow for
sin, and true repentance. There must be deep, faithful
searching of heart. The light, frivolous spirit indulged by the
majority of professed Christians must be put away. There is
earnest warfare before all who would subdue the evil tendencies that strive for the mastery.
Solemn are the scenes connected with the closing work of
the atonement. Momentous are the interests therein involved.
The Judgment is now passing in the sanctuary above.
Forty years has this work been in progress. Soon—none
know how soon—it will pass to the cases of the living. In
the awful presence of God our lives are to come up in
review. At this time above all others it behooves every soul
to heed the Saviour’s admonition, “Watch and pray, for ye
know not when the time is.” “Watch ye therefore, . . . lest
coming suddenly He find you sleeping.” Mark 13:33, 35,
36.
“If therefore thou shalt not watch, I will come on thee as a
thief; and thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon
thee.” Revelation 3:3. How perilous is the condition of
those, who, growing weary of their watch, turn to the
attractions of the world. While the man of business is absorbed in the pursuit of gain, while the pleasure-lover is seeking indulgence, while the daughter of fashion is arranging
her adornments,—it may be in that hour the Judge of all the
earth will pronounce the sentence, “Thou art weighed in the
balances, and art found wanting.”
Every soul that has named the name of Christ has a case
pending at the heavenly tribunal. It is court week with us,
and the decision passed upon each case will be final.
“It is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment.” Hebrews 9:27.
“God . . hath appointed a day in which He will judge the world.” Acts 17:30-31.

Chapter Twenty Four

— The Origin of Evil

———————————————————————

How DID evil begin? Why IS there sin anyway? Here is one of
the most sweeping chapters in this entire book of the ages. Read
that most amazing of stories—how sin began —
Although surrounded by continual selflessness, something
happened. What could turn an angel of light into a devil—and
do it right in the middle of heaven? This is something you will
want to read. It will tell you why God had to wait—and the wonderful future in store for His children—because He did —

———————————————————————

To many minds the origin of sin and the reason for its
existence are a source of great perplexity. In their interest in these questions, the truths plainly revealed in God’s
word and essential to salvation are neglected; and the
fact that the Scriptures furnish no explanation, is seized upon
as an excuse for rejecting the words of Holy Writ.
It is impossible to explain the origin of sin, or to give a
reason for its existence. It is an intruder, for whose existence no reason can be given. It is mysterious, unaccountable; to excuse it, is to defend it. Could it be excused, could
a cause be shown for its existence, it would cease to be sin.
Our only definition of sin is that given in the word of God; it
is “the transgression of the law.”
Sin originated with him, who, next to Christ, stood
highest in the favor of God, and highest in power and
glory among the inhabitants of Heaven. Before his fall,
Lucifer was the covering cherub, holy and undefiled. The
prophet of God declares, “Thou wast perfect in thy ways
from the day that thou wast created, till iniquity was found

280

The

Great

Controversy

in thee.” Ezekiel 28:15. Peace and joy, in perfect submission
to the will of Heaven, existed throughout the angelic host.
Love to God was supreme, love for one another impartial.
Such was the condition that existed for ages before the entrance of sin.
But over this happy state there came a change. Says the
prophet, addressing the prince of evil, “Thine heart was lifted
up because of thy beauty, thou hast corrupted thy wisdom by
reason of thy brightness.” Ezekiel 28:17. Though God had
created Lucifer noble and beautiful, and had exalted him
to high honor among the angelic host, yet He had not
placed him beyond the possibility of evil. It was in Satan’s
power, did he choose to do so, to pervert these gifts. He
might have remained in favor with God, beloved and honored by all the angelic throng, presiding in his exalted position with generous, unselfish care, exercising his noble powers to bless others and to glorify his Maker. But, little by
little, he began to seek his own honor, and to employ his
powers to attract attention and win praise to himself. He
also gradually led the angels over whom he ruled to do him
service, instead of devoting all their powers to the service of
their Creator. This course perverted his own imagination,
and perverted those who yielded implicitly to his authority.
The heavenly councils admonished Lucifer to change
his course. The Son of God warned and entreated him not to
venture thus to dishonor his Maker, and bring ruin upon himself. But instead of yielding, Satan represented to those who
loved him, that he had been wrongly judged, that his dignity
was not respected, and that his liberty was to be abridged.
That Christ should regard him as needing to be corrected, and should presume to take the position of a superior, aroused in him a spirit of resistance, and he charged
the Son of God with a design to humble him before the angels. By misrepresentation of the words of Christ, by prevarication and direct falsehood, Satan secured the sympathy
of the angels under his control, and they united with him in
revolt against Heaven’s authority.
To the last, he refused to acknowledge his own course

The Origin of Evil

[493-497]

281

to be deserving of censure. When the consequence of his
disaffection became apparent, and it was decreed that with
all his sympathizers he must be forever banished from the
abode of bliss, the arch-deceiver threw the blame wholly upon
Christ. With one accord, Satan and his hosts declared that
had they not been reproved, the rebellion would never have
occurred, thus making Christ responsible for their course.
Thus stubborn and defiant in their disloyalty, seeking vainly
to overthrow the government of God, yet blasphemously
claiming to be themselves the innocent victims of oppressive power, the arch-rebel and all his sympathizers were at
last banished from Heaven.
The rebellion in Heaven was prompted by the same
spirit which inspires rebellion on earth. Satan has continued with men the same policy which he pursued with the
angels. His spirit now reigns in the children of disobedience.
There is a constant hatred of reproof, and a disposition
to rebel against it. When God sends to wrong-doers a message of warning or correction, Satan leads them to justify
themselves, and to seek the sympathy of others. Instead of
changing their wrong course, they manifest great indignation against the reprover, as if he were the sole cause of difficulty. From the days of righteous Abel to our own time,
such is the spirit which has been displayed toward those who
dare to condemn sin.
Satan had excited sympathy in his favor by representing
that God had dealt unjustly with him in bestowing supreme
honor upon Christ. Before he was sentenced to banishment
from Heaven, his course was with convincing clearness
shown to be wrong, and he was granted an opportunity to
confess his sin, and submit to God’s authority as just and
righteous. But he chose to carry his points at all hazards. To
sustain his charge of God’s injustice toward him, he resorted to misrepresentation, even of the words and acts
of the Creator.
Here, for a time, Satan had the advantage; and he exulted
in his arrogated superiority, in this one respect, to the angels
of Heaven, and even to God Himself. While Satan can em-

282

The

Great

Controversy

ploy fraud and sophistry to accomplish his objects, God cannot lie; while Lucifer, like the serpent, can choose a tortuous
course, turning, twisting, gliding, to conceal himself, God
moves only in a direct, straight-forward line. Satan had disguised himself in a cloak of falsehood, and for a time it
was impossible to tear off the covering, so that the hideous deformity of his character could be seen. He must
be left to reveal himself in his cruel, artful, wicked works.
He was not immediately dethroned when he first ventured
to indulge the spirit of discontent and insubordination, nor
even when he began to present his false claim and lying representations before the loyal angels. Long was he retained
in Heaven. Again and again was he offered pardon on
condition of repentance and submission. Such efforts as
God alone could make, were made to convince him of his
error, and restore him to the path of rectitude. God would
preserve the order of the heavens, and had Lucifer been willing to return to his allegiance, humble and obedient, he would
have been re-established in his office as covering cherub.
But as he stubbornly justified his course, and maintained
that he had no need of repentance, it became necessary
for the Lord of Heaven to vindicate His justice and the
honor of His throne; and Satan and all who sympathized
with him were cast out.
By the same misrepresentation of the character of God
as he had practiced in Heaven, causing him to be regarded as severe and tyrannical, Satan induced man to
sin. And having succeeded thus far, he declared that God’s
unjust restrictions had led to man’s fall, as they had led to
his own rebellion.
But the Eternal One himself proclaims his character: “The
Lord God, merciful and gracious, long-suffering, and abundant in goodness and truth, keeping mercy for thousands,
forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, and that will by
no means clear the guilty.” Exodus 34:6, 7.
In the banishment of Satan from Heaven, God declared His justice, and maintained the honor of His
throne. But when man had sinned through yielding to

The Origin of Evil

[497-501]

283

the deceptions of this apostate spirit, God gave an evidence of His love by yielding up His only begotten Son to
die for the fallen race. In the atonement the character of
God stands revealed. The mighty argument of the cross demonstrates to the whole universe that God was in no wise responsible for the course of sin that Lucifer had chosen; that
it was no arbitrary withdrawal of divine grace, no deficiency
in the divine government, which inspired in him the spirit of
rebellion.
In the contest between Christ and Satan, during the
Saviour’s earthly ministry, the character of the great deceiver was unmasked. Nothing could so effectually have
uprooted Satan from the minds and affections of the heavenly angels and the whole loyal universe as did his cruel
warfare upon the world’s Redeemer. The daring blasphemy
of his demand that Christ should pay him homage, his presumptuous boldness in bearing Him to the mountain summit and the pinnacle of the temple, the malicious intent betrayed in urging Him to cast Himself down from the dizzy
height, the unsleeping malice that hunted him from place to
place, inspiring the hearts of priests and people to reject His
love, and at the last to raise the cry “Crucify Him! crucify
Him!”—all this excited the amazement and indignation of
the universe.
It was Satan that prompted the world’s rejection of
Christ. The prince of evil exerted all his power and cunning to destroy Jesus; for he saw that the Saviour’s mercy
and love, His compassion and pitying tenderness, were
representing to the world the character of God. Satan
contested every claim put forth by the Son of God, and employed men as his agents to fill the Saviour’s life with suffering and sorrow. The sophistry and falsehood by which he
had sought to hinder the work of Jesus, the hatred manifested through the children of disobedience, his cruel accusations against Him whose life was one of unexampled goodness, all sprang from deep-seated revenge. The pent-up fires
of envy and malice, hatred and revenge, burst forth on
Calvary against the Son of God, while all Heaven gazed

284

The

Great

Controversy

upon the scene in silent horror.
When the great sacrifice had been consummated, Christ
ascended on high, refusing the adoration of angels until He
had preferred the request, “I will that they also whom Thou
hast given me, be with me where I am.” John 17:24. Then
with inexpressible love and power came forth the answer
from the Father’s throne, “Let all the angels of God worship
him.” Hebrews 1:6. Not a stain rested upon Jesus. His humiliation ended, His sacrifice completed, there was given
unto Him a name that is above every name.
Now the guilt of Satan stood forth without excuse. His
lying charges against the divine character and government appeared in their true light. He had accused God of
seeking merely the exaltation of Himself in requiring submission and obedience from His creatures, and had declared
that while the Creator exacted self-denial from all others, He
Himself practiced no self-denial, and made no sacrifice. Now
it was seen that for the salvation of a fallen and sinful race,
the Ruler of the universe had made the greatest sacrifice which
God could make. It was seen, also, that while Lucifer had
opened the door for the entrance of sin, by his desire for
honor and supremacy, Christ had, in order to destroy sin,
humbled Himself, and become obedient unto death.
God had manifested His abhorrence of the principles
of rebellion. All Heaven saw his justice revealed, both in
the condemnation of Satan and in the redemption of man.
Lucifer had declared God’s law to be of such a character that
its penalty could not be remitted, and therefore every transgressor must be forever debarred from the Creator’s favor.
He had claimed that the sinful race were placed beyond redemption, and were therefore his rightful prey. But the death
of Christ was an argument in man’s behalf that could not be
turned aside. He suffered the penalty of the law. God was
just in permitting His wrath to fall upon Him who was equal
with Himself, and man was set free to accept the righteousness of Christ, and by a life of penitence and humiliation to
triumph as the Son of God had triumphed over the power of
Satan.

The Origin of Evil

[501-503]

285

God’s law stands fully vindicated. He is just, and yet
the justifier of all who believe in Jesus. Nothing less than
this plan of atonement could convince the whole universe
of God’s justice.
In the final execution of the judgment it will be seen
that no cause for sin exists. When the Judge of all the earth
shall demand of Satan, “Why hast thou rebelled against Me,
and robbed Me of the subjects of My kingdom?” the originator of evil can render no excuse. Every mouth will be
stopped, and all the hosts of rebellion will be speechless before the great tribunal.

and lives of all who cry to Him for strength and help —
To the humble repentant, believing soul—nothing is withheld that he needs in order to keep close to his precious Jesus.
Here is a chapter with a promise to claim right now —

———————————————————————

“I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and
between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head,
and thou shalt bruise His heel.” Genesis 3:15. The divine sentence pronounced against Satan after the fall of
man, was also a prophecy, embracing all the ages to the
close of time, and foreshadowing the great conflict to engage all the races of men who should live upon the earth.
God declares, “I will put enmity.” This enmity is not
naturally entertained. When man transgressed the divine law, his nature became evil, and he was in harmony,
and not at variance, with Satan. There exists naturally no
enmity between sinful man and the originator of sin. Both
became evil through apostasy. The apostate is never at rest,
except as he obtains sympathy and support by inducing others to follow his example. For this reason, fallen angels and
wicked men unite in desperate companionship. Had not God
specially interposed, Satan and man would have entered into
an alliance against Heaven; and instead of cherishing enmity against Satan, the whole human family would have been
united in opposition to God.

Enmity between Man and Satan

[505-507]

287

Satan tempted man to sin, as he had caused angels to
rebel, that he might thus secure co-operation in his warfare against Heaven. There was no dissension between himself and the fallen angels as regards their hatred of Christ;
while on all other points there was discord, they were firmly
united in opposing the authority of the Ruler of the universe.
But when Satan heard the declaration that enmity should exist
between himself and the woman, and between his seed and
her seed, he knew that his efforts to deprave human nature
would be interrupted; that by some means man was to be
enabled to resist his power.
The grace that Christ implants in the soul creates the
enmity against Satan. Without this converting grace and
renewing power, man would continue the captive of Satan, a servant ever ready to do his bidding. But the new
principle in the soul creates conflict where hitherto had been
peace. The power which Christ imparts, enables man to resist the tyrant and usurper. Whoever is seen to abhor sin
instead of loving it, whoever resists and conquers those passions that have held sway within, displays the operation of a
principle wholly from above.
The antagonism that exists between the spirit of Christ
and the spirit of Satan was most strikingly displayed in
the world’s reception of Jesus. It was not so much because
He appeared without worldly wealth, pomp, or grandeur, that
the Jews were led to reject Him. They saw that He possessed
power which would more than compensate for the lack of
these outward advantages. But the purity and holiness of
Christ called forth against Him the hatred of the ungodly.
His life of self-denial and sinless devotion was a perpetual
reproof to a proud, sensual people. It was this that evoked
enmity against the Son of God. Satan and evil angels joined
with evil men. All the energies of apostasy conspired against
the champion of truth.
The same enmity is manifested toward Christ’s followers as was manifested toward their Master. Whoever
sees the repulsive character of sin, and, in strength from
above, resists temptation, will assuredly arouse the wrath of

288

The

Great

Controversy

Satan and his subjects. Hatred of the pure principles of truth,
and reproach and persecution of its advocates, will exist as
long as sin and sinners remain. The followers of Christ and
the servants of Satan cannot harmonize. The offense of the
cross has not ceased. “All that will live godly in Christ Jesus
shall suffer persecution.” 2 Timothy 3:12.
Satan’s agents are constantly working under his direction to establish his authority and build up his kingdom in opposition to the government of God. To this end
they seek to deceive Christ’s followers, and allure them from
their allegiance. Like their leader, they misconstrue and pervert the Scriptures to accomplish their object. As Satan endeavored to cast reproach upon God, so do his agents seek
to malign God’s people. The spirit which put Christ to death
moves the wicked to destroy His followers. All this is foreshadowed in that first prophecy, “I will put enmity between
thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed.”
Such is the work that will be carried forward in the great
controversy between Christ and Satan to the close of time.
Satan summons all his forces, and throws his whole
power into the combat. Why is it that he meets with no
greater resistance? Why are the soldiers of Christ so
sleepy and indifferent?—Because they do not realize their
peril. There is but little enmity against Satan and his works,
because there is so great ignorance concerning his power and
malice, and the vast extent of his warfare against Christ and
His church. Multitudes are deluded here. They do not know
that their enemy is a mighty general, who controls the minds
of evil angels, and that with well-matured plans and skillful
movements he is warring against Christ to prevent the salvation of souls. Among professed Christians, and even among
ministers of the gospel, there is heard scarcely a reference to
Satan, except perhaps an incidental mention in the pulpit.
They overlook the evidences of his continual activity and
success; they neglect the many warnings of his subtlety; they
seem to ignore his very existence.
While men are ignorant of his devices, this vigilant
foe is upon their track every moment. He is intruding his

presence in every department of the household, in every street
of our cities, in the churches, in the councils, in the courts of
justice, perplexing, deceiving, seducing, everywhere ruining
the souls and bodies of men, women, and children, breaking
up families, sowing hatred, emulation, strife, sedition, murder. And the Christian world seem to regard these things as
though God had appointed them, and they must exist.
Satan is continually seeking to overcome the people
of God by breaking down the barriers which separate
them from the world. Ancient Israel were enticed into sin
when they ventured into forbidden association with the heathen. In a similar manner are modern Israel led astray. “The
god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who
is the image of God, should shine unto them.” 2 Corinthians
4:4. All who are not decided followers of Christ are servants
of Satan. In the unregenerate heart there is love of sin, and a
disposition to cherish and excuse it. In the renewed heart
there is hatred of sin, and determined resistance against it.
When Christians choose the society of the ungodly and unbelieving, they expose themselves to temptation. Satan conceals himself from view, and stealthily draws his bandage
across their eyes. They cannot see that such company is calculated to do them harm, and while all the time assimilating
to the world in character, words, and actions, they are becoming more and more blinded. Familiarity with sin inevitably causes it to appear less repulsive. He who chooses to
associate with the servants of Satan soon ceases to fear their
master.
The tempter often works most successfully through
those who are least suspected of being under his control.
The opinion prevails with many that all which appears like
courtesy or refinement must, in some sense, pertain to Christ.
Never was there a greater mistake. These qualities should
grace the character of every Christian, for they would exert a
powerful influence in favor of true religion; but they must
be consecrated to God, or they are a power for evil. Many
who are affable and intelligent, and who would not stoop to

what is commonly regarded as an immoral act, are but polished instruments in the hands of Satan. The insidious, deceptive character of their influence and example renders them
more dangerous enemies to the cause of Christ than are those
who are unattractive, coarse, rough, and degraded.
By earnest prayer and dependence upon God, Solomon obtained the wisdom which excited the wonder and
admiration of the world. But when he turned from the
Source of his strength, and went forward relying upon himself, he fell a prey to temptation. Then the marvelous powers
bestowed on this wisest of kings, only rendered him a more
efficient agent of the adversary of souls.
While Satan is constantly seeking to blind their minds
to the fact, let Christians never forget that they “wrestle
not against flesh and blood, but against principalities,
against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this
world, against wicked spirits [margin] in high places.”
Ephesians 6:12. The inspired warning is sounding down the
centuries to our time: “Be sober, be vigilant; because your
adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking
whom he may devour.” 1 Peter 5:8. “Put on the whole armor
of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the
devil.” Ephesians 6:11.
From the days of Adam to our own time, our great
enemy has been exercising his power to oppress and destroy. He is now preparing for his last campaign against
the church. All who seek to follow Jesus will be brought
into conflict with this relentless foe. The more nearly the
Christian imitates the divine Pattern, the more surely will he
make himself a mark for the attacks of Satan. All who are
actively engaged in the cause of God, seeking to unveil the
deceptions of the evil one and to present Christ before the
people, will be able to join in the testimony of Paul, in which
he speaks of serving the Lord with all humility of mind, with
many tears and temptations.
Satan assailed Christ with His fiercest and most subtle
temptations; but he was repulsed in every conflict. Those
battles were fought in our behalf; those victories make it

Enmity between Man and Satan

[509-510]

291

possible for us to conquer. Christ will give strength to all
who seek it. No man without his own consent can be overcome by Satan. The tempter has no power to control the will
or to force the soul to sin. He may distress, but he cannot
contaminate. He can cause agony, but not defilement. The
fact that Christ has conquered should inspire His followers with courage to fight manfully the battle against
sin and Satan.

With countless fallen angels to do his bidding, and with a mind far in
advance of our own, we are no match for his power and cunning.
But in Christ there is the power needed. Our danger is in not
recognizing the strength and number of Satan’s host—and thus
thinking ourselves safe. We do not flee to Christ, moment by moment, for the help we need.

———————————————————————

The existence of Satan and the agency of evil spirits
are facts fully established by both the Old and the New
Testament. From the days of Adam to Moses, and through
all the succeeding ages to John, the latest gospel writer, Satan is recognized as an active, personal agent, the originator
of evil, the enemy of God and man. It is true that imagination and superstition have given their own coloring to these
facts, and have linked them with legends and traditions of
heathen, Jewish, and even Christian nations; but as revealed
in the word of God they are of the utmost solemnity and
importance. The connection of the visible with the invisible world, the ministration of angels of God, and the
agency of evil angels, are inseparably interwoven with
human history. We are told of the fall of the angels from
their purity, of Lucifer their leader, the instigator of rebellion, of their confederacy and government, of their various
orders, of their great intelligence and subtlety, and of their
malicious designs against the innocence and happiness of
men. We are told of One mightier than the fallen foe,—

Agency of Evil Spirits

[511-514]

293

One by whose authority Satan’s power is limited and
controlled; and we are told, also, of the punishment prepared for the originator of iniquity.
During the time when Christ was upon the earth, evil
spirits manifested their power in a most striking manner. And why was this?—Christ had come to enter upon the
plan devised for man’s redemption, and Satan therefore determined to assert his right to control the world. He had succeeded in establishing idolatry in every part of the earth except the land of Palestine. To the only land that had not fully
yielded to the tempter’s sway, Christ came to shed upon the
people the light of Heaven. Here two rival powers claimed
supremacy. Jesus was stretching out His arms of love, inviting all who would to find pardon and peace in Him. The
hosts of darkness understood that if His mission should be
successful, their rule was soon to end. Satan raged like a
chained lion, and defiantly exhibited his power over the bodies as well as the souls of men.
The fact that men have been possessed with demons
is clearly stated in the New Testament. The persons thus
afflicted were not merely suffering with disease from natural
causes. Christ had perfect understanding of that with which
He was dealing, and He recognized the direct presence and
agency of evil spirits.
A striking example of their number, power, and malignity, and also of the power and mercy of Christ, is given
in the Scripture account of the healing of the demoniacs
at Gadara. Those wretched maniacs, spurning all restraint,
writhing, foaming, raging, were filling the air with their cries,
doing violence to themselves, and endangering all who should
approach them. Their bleeding and disfigured bodies and
distracted minds presented a spectacle well-pleasing to the
prince of darkness. One of the demons controlling the sufferers declared, “My name is Legion; for we are many.” Mark
5:9. In the Roman army a legion consisted of from three to
five thousand men. Satan’s hosts also are marshaled into
companies, and the single company to which these demons
belonged numbered no less than a legion.

294

The

Great

Controversy

At the command of Jesus, the evil spirits departed from
their victims, leaving them calmly sitting at the Saviour’s
feet, subdued, intelligent, and gentle. But the demons were
permitted to sweep a herd of swine into the sea; and to the
dwellers of Gadara their loss outweighed the blessings which
Christ had bestowed, and the divine Healer was entreated to
depart. This was the result which Satan designed to secure.
By casting the blame upon Jesus, he aroused the selfish fears
of the people, and prevented them from listening to his words.
Satan is constantly accusing Christians as the cause of loss,
misfortune, and suffering, instead of allowing the reproach
to fall where it belongs, upon himself and his agents.
But the purposes of Christ were not thwarted. He allowed
the evil spirits to destroy the herd of swine as a rebuke to
those Jews, who, by raising these unclean beasts for the sake
of gain, had transgressed the command of God. Had not
Christ restrained the demons, they would have plunged into
the sea, not only the swine, but also their keepers and owners. The preservation of both the keepers and the owners
was due alone to His merciful interposition for their deliverance. Furthermore, this scene was permitted to take place
that the disciples might witness the cruel power of Satan
upon both man and beast. The Saviour desired His followers to have a knowledge of the foe whom they were to
meet, that they might not be deceived and overcome by
his devices. It was also His will that the people of that region should behold His power to break the bondage of Satan
and release His captives. And though Jesus Himself departed,
the men so marvelously delivered, remained to declare the
mercy of their Benefactor.
Other instances of a similar nature are recorded in
the Scriptures. The daughter of the Syrophenician woman
was grievously vexed with a devil, whom Jesus cast out by
His word. Mark 7:26-30. One “possessed with a devil, blind
and dumb,” (Matthew 12:22) a youth who had a dumb spirit,
that ofttimes “cast him into the fire, and into the waters, to
destroy him,” (Mark 9:17-27) the maniac, who, tormented
by “a spirit of an unclean devil” (Luke 4:33-36), disturbed

Agency of Evil Spirits

[514-516]

the Sabbath quiet of the synagogue at Capernaum, were all
healed by the compassionate Saviour. In nearly every instance, Christ addressed the demon as an intelligent entity,
commanding him to come out of his victim and to torment
him no more. The worshipers at Capernaum, beholding His
mighty power, “were all amazed, and spake among themselves, saying, What a word is this! for with authority and
power He commandeth the unclean spirits, and they come
out.”
Those possessed with devils are usually represented
as being in a condition of great suffering; yet there were
exceptions to this rule. For the sake of obtaining supernatural power, some welcomed the Satanic influence.
These of course had no conflict with the demons. Of this
class were those who possessed the spirit of divination,—
Simon Magus, Elymas the sorcerer, and the damsel who followed Paul and Silas at Philippi.
None are in greater danger from the influence of evil
spirits than are those who, notwithstanding the direct
and ample testimony of the Scriptures, deny the existence and agency of the devil and his angels. So long as we
are ignorant of their wiles, they have almost inconceivable
advantage; many give heed to their suggestions while they
suppose themselves to be following the dictates of their own
wisdom. This is why, as we approach the close of time, when
Satan is to work with greatest power to deceive and destroy,
he spreads everywhere the belief that he does not exist. It is
his policy to conceal himself and his manner of working.
There is nothing that the great deceiver fears so much
as that we shall become acquainted with his devices. The
better to disguise his real character and purposes, he has
caused himself to be so represented as to excite no stronger
emotion than ridicule or contempt. He is well pleased to be
painted as a ludicrous or loathsome object, misshapen, half
animal and half human. He is pleased to hear his name used
in sport and mockery by those who consider themselves intelligent and well-informed.
It is because he has masked himself with consummate

296

The

Great

Controversy

skill that the question is so widely asked, “Does such a
being really exist?” It is an evidence of his success that
theories giving the lie to the plainest testimony of the Scriptures are so generally received in the religious world. And it
is because Satan can most readily control the minds of those
who are unconscious of his influence that the word of God
gives us so many examples of his malignant work, unveiling
before us his secret forces, and thus placing us on our guard
against his assaults.
The power and malice of Satan and his host might
justly alarm us, were it not that we may find shelter and
deliverance in the superior power of our Redeemer. We
carefully secure our houses with bolts and locks to protect
our property and our lives from evil men; but we seldom
think of the evil angels who are constantly seeking access to
us, and against whose attacks we have no method of defense.
If permitted, they can distract our minds, disorder, torment
our bodies, destroy our possessions and our lives. Their only
delight is in misery and destruction. Fearful is the condition of those who resist the divine claims and yield to
Satan’s temptations until God gives them up to the control of evil spirits. But those who follow Christ are ever
safe under His watchcare. Angels that excel in strength
are sent from Heaven to protect them. The wicked one
cannot break through the guard which God has stationed
about His people.

Satan is determined to entrap ever
everyone
yone who would seek to
become a Christian. And he wants their children as well. Many
are caught everyday, not realizing how he operates —
This chapter tells about Satan’s toolbox, for he has scores
of devices to destroy souls—and yet most people are not even
aware that such tools exist. Here are Satan’s sixty-five snares —

———————————————————————

As the people of God approach the perils of the last
days, Satan holds earnest consultation with his angels as
to the most successful plan of overthrowing their faith.
He sees that the popular churches are already lulled to
sleep by his deceptive power. By pleasing sophistry and
lying wonders he can continue to hold them under his
control. Therefore he directs his angels to lay their snares
especially for those who are looking for the second advent of Christ, and endeavoring to keep all the commandments of God.
Says the great deceiver: “We must watch those who
are calling the attention of the people to the Sabbath of
Jehovah; they will lead many to see the claims of the law of
God; and the same light which reveals the true Sabbath, reveals also the ministration of Christ in the heavenly sanctuary, and shows that the last work for man’s salvation is now
going forward. Hold the minds of the people in darkness till
that work is ended, and we shall secure the world and the
church also.
“The Sabbath is the great question which is to decide
the destiny of souls. We must exalt the Sabbath of our

298

The

creating. We have caused it to be accepted by both worldlings and church-members; now the church must be led to
unite with the world in its support. We must work by signs
and wonders to blind their eyes to the truth, and lead them to
lay aside reason and the fear of God, and follow custom and
tradition.
“I will influence popular ministers to turn the attention of their hearers from the commandments of God.
That which the Scriptures declare to be a perfect law of liberty shall be represented as a yoke of bondage. The people
accept their ministers’ explanations of Scripture, and do not
investigate for themselves. Therefore by working through
the ministers, I can control the people according to my will.
“But our principal concern is to silence this sect of
Sabbath-keepers. We must excite popular indignation
against them. We will enlist great men and worldly-wise
men upon our side, and induce those in authority to carry out
our purposes. Then the Sabbath which I have set up shall be
enforced by laws the most severe and exacting. Those who
disregard them shall be driven out from the cities and villages, and made to suffer hunger and privation. When once
we have the power, we will show that we can do with those
who will not swerve from their allegiance to God. We led the
Romish Church to inflict imprisonment, torture, and death
upon those who refused to yield to her decrees, and now that
we are bringing the Protestant churches and the world into
harmony with this right arm of our strength, we will finally
have a law to exterminate all who will not submit to our
authority. When death shall be made the penalty of violating
our Sabbath, then many who are now ranked with commandment-keepers will come over to our side.
“But before proceeding to these extreme measures,
we must exert all our wisdom and subtlety to deceive
and ensnare those who honor the true Sabbath. We can
separate many from Christ by worldliness, lust, and pride.
They may think themselves safe because they believe the
truth, but indulgence of appetite or the lower passions, which
will confuse judgment and destroy discrimination, will cause

The Snares of Satan

[ -- ]

their fall.
“Go, make the possessors of lands and money drunk
with the cares of this life. Present the world before them in
its most attractive light, that they may lay up their treasure
here, and fix their affections upon earthly things. We must
do our utmost to prevent those who labor in God’s cause
from obtaining means to use against us. Keep the money in
our own ranks. The more means they obtain, the more they
will injure our kingdom by taking from us our subjects. Make
them care more for money than for the upbuilding of Christ’s
kingdom and the spread of the truths we hate, and we need
not fear their influence; for we know that every selfish, covetous person will fall under our power, and will finally be
separated from God’s people.
“Through those that have a form of godliness but know
not the power, we can gain many who would otherwise
do us great harm. Lovers of pleasure more than lovers of
God will be our most effective helpers. Those of this class
who are apt and intelligent will serve as decoys to draw others into our snares. Many will not fear their influence, because they profess the same faith. We will thus lead them to
conclude that the requirements of Christ are less strict than
they once believed, and that by conformity to the world they
would exert a greater influence with worldlings. Thus they
will separate from Christ; then they will have no strength to
resist our power, and erelong they will be ready to ridicule
their former zeal and devotion.
“Until the great decisive blow shall be struck, our efforts against commandment-keepers must be untiring.
We must be present at all their gatherings. In their large meetings especially our cause will suffer much, and we must exercise great vigilance, and employ all our seductive arts to
prevent souls from hearing the truth and becoming impressed
by it.
“I will have upon the ground, as my agents, men holding false doctrines mingled with just enough truth to deceive souls. I will also have unbelieving ones present, who
will express doubts in regard to the Lord’s messages of warn-

300

The

Great

Controversy

ing to his church. Should the people read and believe these
admonitions, we could have little hope of overcoming them.
But if we can divert their attention from these warnings, they
will remain ignorant of our power and cunning, and we shall
secure them in our ranks at last. God will not permit His
words to be slighted with impunity. If we can keep souls
deceived for a time, God’s mercy will be withdrawn, and He
will give them up to our full control.
“We must cause distraction and division. We must destroy their anxiety for their own souls, and lead them to
criticise, to judge, and to accuse and condemn one another,
and to cherish selfishness and enmity. For these sins, God
banished us from His presence; and all who follow our example will meet a similar fate.”
The Scriptures declare that upon one occasion, when the
angels of God came to present themselves before the Lord,
Satan came also among them, not to bow before the Eternal
King, but to further his own malicious designs against the
righteous. With the same object he is in attendance when
men assemble for the worship of God. Though hidden from
sight, he is working with all diligence to control the minds of
the worshipers. Like a skillful general, he lays his plans beforehand. As he sees the messenger of God searching the
Scriptures, he takes note of the subject to be presented to the
people. Then he employs all his cunning and shrewdness to
so control circumstances that the message may not reach those
whom he is deceiving on that very point. The one who most
needs the warning will be urged into some business transaction which requires his presence, or will by some other means
be prevented from hearing the words that might prove to
him a savor of life unto life.
Again, Satan sees the Lord’s servants burdened because of the spiritual darkness that enshrouds the people.
He hears their earnest prayers for divine grace and power to
break the spell of indifference, carelessness, and indolence.
Then with renewed zeal he plies his arts. He tempts men to
the indulgence of appetite or to some other form of self-gratification, and thus benumbs their sensibilities, so that they

The Snares of Satan

[ --, 518-520]

301

fail to hear the very things which they most need to learn.
Satan well knows that all whom he can lead to neglect
prayer and the searching of the Scriptures will be overcome by his attacks. Therefore he invents every possible
device to engross the mind. There has ever been a class professing godliness who, instead of following on to know the
truth, make it their religion to seek some fault of character or
error of faith in those with whom they do not agree. Such are
Satan’s right-hand helpers. Accusers of the brethren are not
few; and they are always active when God is at work, and
His servants are rendering Him true homage. They will put a
false coloring upon the words and acts of those who love
and obey the truth. They will represent the most earnest, zealous, self-denying servants of Christ as deceived or deceivers. It is their work to misrepresent the motives of every true
and noble deed, to circulate insinuations, and arouse suspicion in the minds of the inexperienced. In every conceivable
manner they will seek to cause that which is pure and righteous to be regarded as foul and deceptive. And in this work
the agents of Satan have their master and his angels to help
them.
But none need be deceived concerning them. It may be
readily seen whose children they are, whose example they
follow, and whose work they do. “Ye shall know them by
their fruits.” Matthew 7:16. They closely resemble Satan,
the envenomed slanderer, the accuser of the brethren.
It is Satan’s plan to bring into the church insincere,
unregenerate elements that will encourage doubt and
unbelief, and hinder all who desire to see the work of
God advance, and to advance with it. Many who have no
real faith in God or in His word, assent to some principles of
truth, and pass as Christians; and thus they are enabled to
introduce their errors as scriptural doctrines.
The position that it is of no consequence what men
believe, is one of Satan’s most successful deceptions. He
knows that the truth, received in the love of it, sanctifies the
soul of the receiver; therefore he is constantly seeking to substitute false theories, fables, another gospel. From the be-

302

The

Great

Controversy

ginning, the servants of God have contended against false
teachers, not merely as vicious men, but as inculcators of
falsehoods that were fatal to the soul. Elijah, Jeremiah, Paul,
firmly and fearlessly opposed those who were turning men
from the word of God. That liberality which regards a correct religious faith as unimportant, found no favor with these
holy defenders of the truth.
The vague and fanciful interpretations of Scripture,
and the many conflicting theories concerning religious
faith, that are found in the Christian world, are the work
of our great adversary to so confuse minds that they shall
not discern the truth. And the discord and division which
exists among the churches of Christendom is in a great measure due to the prevailing custom of wresting the Scriptures
to support a favorite theory. Instead of carefully studying
God’s word with humility of heart to obtain a knowledge of
His will, many seek only to discover something odd or original.
In order to sustain erroneous doctrines or unchristian practices, they seize upon passages of Scripture separated from the context, perhaps quoting half of a single
verse as proving their point, when the remaining portion
would show the meaning to be quite the opposite. With the
cunning of the serpent, they entrench themselves behind disconnected utterances construed to suit their carnal desires.
Thus do many willfully pervert the word of God. Others,
who have an active imagination, seize upon the figures and
symbols of Holy Writ, interpret to suit their fancy, with little
regard to the testimony of Scripture as its own interpreter,
and then they present their vagaries as the teachings of God’s
word.
Whenever the study of the Scriptures is entered upon
without a prayerful, humble, teachable spirit, the plainest and simplest as well as the most difficult passages
will be wrested from their true meaning. The papal leaders select such portions of Scripture as best serve their purpose, interpret to suit themselves, and then present these to
the people, while they deny them the privilege of studying

The Snares of Satan

[520-522]

303

the Bible, and understanding its sacred truths for themselves.
Unless the whole Bible is given to the people just as it reads,
it would be better for them not to have it at all.
The Bible was designed to be a guide to all who wish
to become acquainted with the will of their Maker. God
gave to men the sure word of prophecy; angels and even
Christ Himself came to make known to Daniel and John the
things that must shortly come to pass. Those important matters that concern our salvation were not left involved in mystery. They were not revealed in such a way as to perplex and
mislead the honest seeker after truth. Said the Lord by the
prophet Habakkuk, “Write the vision, and make it plain upon
tables, that he may run that readeth it.” Habakkuk 2:2. The
word of God is plain to all who study it with a prayerful
heart. Every truly honest soul will come to the light of truth.
“Light is sown for the righteous.” Psalm 97:11. No church
can advance in holiness unless its members are earnestly seeking for truth as for hid treasure.
By the cry of liberality, men are blinded to the devices
of their adversary, while he is all the time working steadily for the accomplishment of his object. As he succeeds
in supplanting the word of truth by human speculations, the
law of God is set aside, and the churches are under the bondage of sin while they claim to be free.
To many, scientific research has become a curse; their
finite minds are so weak that they lose their balance. They
cannot harmonize their views of science with Scripture statements, and they think that the Bible is to be tested by their
standard of “science falsely so called.” Thus they err from
the faith, and are seduced by the devil. Men have endeavored to be wiser than their Creator; human philosophy has
attempted to search out and explain mysteries which will
never be revealed, through the eternal ages. If men would
but search and understand what God has made known of
Himself and His purposes, they would obtain such a view of
the glory, majesty, and power of Jehovah, that they would
realize their own littleness, and would be content with that
which has been revealed for themselves and their children.

304

The

Great

Controversy

It is a masterpiece of Satan’s deceptions to keep the
minds of men searching and conjecturing in regard to
that which God has not made known, and which He does
not intend that we shall understand. It was thus that Lucifer
himself was cast out of Heaven. He became dissatisfied because all the secrets of God’s purposes were not confided to
him, and he entirely disregarded that which was revealed concerning his own work in the lofty position assigned him. By
arousing the same discontent in the angels under his command, he caused their fall. Now he seeks to imbue the minds
of men with the same spirit, and to lead them also to disregard the direct commands of God.
Those who are unwilling to accept the plain, cutting
truths of the Bible, are continually seeking for pleasing
fables that will quiet their consciences. The less spiritual,
self-denying, and humiliating the doctrines presented, the
greater the favor with which they are received. These persons degrade the intellectual powers to serve their carnal
desires. Too wise in their own conceit to search the word of
God with contrition of soul and earnest prayer for divine
guidance, they have no shield from delusion. Satan is ready
to supply the heart’s desire, and he palms off his deceptions
in the place of truth. It was thus that the papacy gained its
power over the minds of men; and by rejection of the truth
because it involves a cross, Protestants are following the same
path. All who neglect the word of God to study convenience and policy, that they may not be at variance with
the world, will be left to receive damnable heresy for religious truth. The apostle Paul speaks of a class who received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved.”
He says of these, “For this cause God shall send them strong
delusion, that they should believe a lie, that they all might be
damned who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in
unrighteousness.” 2 Thessalonians 2:10-12. With such a
warning before us, it behooves us to be on our guard as to
what doctrines we receive.
Every conceivable form of error will be accepted by
those who willfully reject the truth. Satan has different

The Snares of Satan

[523-525]

305

deceptions prepared to reach different minds; and some who
look with horror upon one deception will readily receive another.
Among the most successful agencies of the great deceiver are the delusive doctrines and lying wonders of
Spiritualism. Disguised as an angel of light, he spreads his
nets where least suspected. If men would but study the word
of God with earnest prayer that they might understand its
teachings, they would not be left in darkness to receive false
doctrines. But as they reject the truth, they fall a prey to these
deceptions.
Another dangerous heresy is the doctrine that denies
the divinity of Christ. Men who have no experimental
knowledge of Jesus, will yet assume an appearance of great
wisdom, as though their judgment were beyond question,
and boldly declare that the Son of God had no existence prior
to His first advent to this world. This position directly contradicts the plainest statements of our Saviour concerning
Himself; yet it is received with favor by a large class who
claim to believe the Scriptures. With such persons it is folly
to argue. No argument, however conclusive, will convince
those who reject the direct testimony of the Son of God. “The
natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God; for
they are foolishness unto him; neither can he know them,
because they are spiritually discerned.” 1 Corinthians 2:14.
Those who persistently cling to such errors, give evidence of
their own ignorance of God and of His Son.
Still another subtle and mischievous error is the fastspreading belief that Satan has no existence as a personal
being; that the name is used in Scripture merely to represent
men’s evil thoughts and desires.
The teaching so widely echoed from popular pulpits,
that the second advent of Christ is His coming to each
individual at death, is a device to divert the minds of men
from His personal coming in the clouds of heaven. For years
Satan has thus been saying, “Behold, He is in the secret chambers;” and many souls have been lost by accepting this deception.

306

The

Great

Controversy

Again, worldly wisdom teaches that prayer is not essential. Men of science claim that there can be no real answer to prayer; that this would be a violation of law, a miracle,
and that miracles have no existence. The universe, say they,
is governed by fixed laws, and God Himself does nothing
contrary to these laws. Thus they represent God as bound by
His own laws; as if the operation of divine laws could exclude divine freedom. Such teaching is opposed to the testimony of the Scriptures. Were not miracles wrought by Christ
and His apostles? The same compassionate Saviour lives
to-day, and He is as willing to listen to the prayer of faith as
when He walked visibly among men. The natural co-operates with the supernatural. It is a part of God’s plan to grant
us, in answer to the prayer of faith, that which He would not
bestow, did we not thus ask.
Innumerable are the erroneous doctrines and fanciful
ideas that are obtaining among the churches of Christendom. It is impossible to estimate the evil results of removing one of the landmarks fixed by the word of God.
Few who venture to do this, stop with the rejection of a single
truth. The majority continue to set aside one after another of
its principles, until they become actual infidels.
And this is the object which Satan seeks to accomplish.
There is nothing that he desires more than to destroy
confidence in God and in His word. Satan stands at the
head of the great army of doubters, and he works to the
utmost of his power to beguile souls into his ranks. It is becoming fashionable to doubt. There are many who seem to
feel that it is a virtue to stand on the side of unbelief, skepticism, and infidelity. But underneath an appearance of candor and humility, it will be found that such persons are actuated by self-confidence and pride. It is a terrible thing to lose
faith in God or in His word. Unbelief strengthens as it is
encouraged. There is danger in even once giving expression to doubt; a seed is sown which produces a harvest of
its kind. Satan will nourish the crop every moment. Those
who allow themselves to talk of their doubts will find them
constantly becoming more confirmed. God will never remove

The Snares of Satan

[525-530]

307

every occasion for doubt. He will never work a miracle to
remove unbelief when He has given sufficient evidence for
faith.
God looks with displeasure upon the self-sufficient and
the unbelieving, who are ever doubting His promises and
distrusting the assurance of His grace. They are unproductive trees that spread their dark branches far and wide,
shutting away the sunlight from other plants, and causing
them to droop and die under the chilling shadow. The lifework of these persons will appear as a never-ceasing witness against them. They are sowing seeds of doubt and skepticism that will yield an unfailing harvest.
The followers of Christ know little of the plots which
Satan and his hosts are forming against them. But He
who sitteth in the heavens will overrule all these devices
for the accomplishment of His deep designs. The Lord
permits His people to be subjected to the fiery ordeal of temptation, not because He takes pleasure in their distress and
affliction, but because this process is essential to their final
victory. He could not, consistently with His own glory, shield
them from temptation; for the very object of the trial is to
prepare them to resist all the allurements of evil.
Satan is well aware that the weakest soul who abides
in Christ is more than a match for the hosts of darkness,
and that, should he reveal himself openly, he would be
met and resisted. Therefore he seeks to draw away the soldiers of the cross from their strong fortification, while he
lies in ambush with his forces, ready to destroy all who venture upon his ground. No man is safe for a day or an hour
without prayer. Especially should we entreat the Lord
for wisdom to understand His word. Satan is an expert in
quoting Scripture, placing his own interpretation upon passages by which he hopes to cause us to stumble. We should
study the Bible with humility of heart, never losing sight of
our dependence upon God. While we must constantly guard
against the devices of Satan, we should pray in faith continually, “Lead us not into temptation.”

— The First Great Deception

———————————————————————

One of the most fantastic deceptions of all time was star
ted
started
by the devil thousands of years ago. Surprisingly enough, few today recognize it for what it is. And yet with it, he catches souls and
holds them fast —
heartt of the spider web—
You are now going to learn the hear
how Satan uses the dead—to catch the living —

———————————————————————

With the earliest history of man, Satan began his efforts to deceive our race. He who had incited rebellion in
Heaven desired to bring the whole creation to unite with
him in his warfare against the government of God. His
envy and jealousy were excited as he looked upon the beautiful home prepared for the happy, holy pair, and he immediately laid his plans to cause their fall. Had he revealed himself in his real character, he would have been repulsed at
once, for Adam and Eve had been warned against this dangerous foe; but he worked in the dark, concealing his purpose, that he might more effectually accomplish his object.
Employing as his medium the serpent, then a creature of
fascinating appearance, he addressed himself to Eve, “Hath
God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?” Genesis 3:1. Had Eve refrained from entering into argument
with the tempter, she would have been safe; but she ventured to parley with him, and fell a victim to his wiles. It
is thus that many are still overcome. They doubt and argue
concerning the requirements of God, and instead of obeying
the divine commands, they accept human theories, which but
disguise the devices of Satan.

The

Deception

[531-533]

309

“The woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the
fruit of the trees of the garden; but of the fruit of the tree
which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall
not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die. And the
serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die; for
God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes
shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and
evil.” Genesis 3:2-5. Eve yielded to temptation, and through
her influence Adam also was deceived. They accepted the
words of the serpent, that God did not mean what He
said; they distrusted their Creator, and imagined that
He was restricting their liberty, and that they might obtain great light and freedom by transgressing His law.
But what did Adam, after his sin, find to be the meaning
of the words, “In the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt
surely die”? Did he find them to mean, as Satan had led him
to believe, that he was to be ushered into a more exalted
state of existence? Then indeed there was great good to be
gained by transgression, and Satan was proved to be a benefactor of the race. But Adam did not so understand the divine sentence. God declared that as a penalty for his sin,
man should return to the ground whence he was taken: “Dust
thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.” Genesis 3:19. The
words of Satan, “Your eyes shall be opened,” proved to
be true only in this sense: After Adam and Eve had disobeyed God, their eyes were opened to discern their folly;
they did know evil, and they tasted the bitter fruit of
transgression.
Immortality had been promised on condition of obedience to the requirements of God. It was forfeited by
disobedience, and Adam became subject to death. He
could not transmit to his posterity that which he did not possess; and there would have been no hope for the fallen race,
had not God, by the sacrifice of His Son, brought immortality within their reach. “The wages of sin is death; but the gift
of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.” Romans 6:23. In no other way can it be obtained. But every
man may come in possession of this priceless blessing if

310

The

Great

Controversy

he will comply with the conditions. All “who by patient
continuance in well-doing seek for glory and honor and immortality,” will receive eternal life. Romans 2:7.
The one who promised Adam life in disobedience was
the great deceiver. The first sermon ever preached upon
the immortality of the soul was preached by the serpent
to Eve in Eden,—“Ye shall not surely die;” and this declaration, resting solely upon the authority of Satan, is echoed from the pulpits of Christendom, and received by the
majority of mankind as readily as it was received by our first
parents. The divine sentence, “The soul that sinneth, it shall
die,” (Ezekiel 18:20) is made to mean, The soul that sinneth,
it shall not die, but live eternally. We cannot but wonder at
the strange infatuation which renders men so credulous concerning the words of Satan, and so unbelieving in regard to
the words of God.
The fruit of the tree of life had the power to perpetuate
life. Had man after his fall been allowed free access to that
tree, he would have lived forever, and thus sin would have
been immortalized. But a flaming sword was placed “to keep
the way of the tree of life,” and not one of the family of
Adam has been permitted to pass that barrier and partake of
the life-giving fruit. Therefore there is not an immortal sinner.
But after the fall, Satan bade his angels make a special effort to foster the belief in man’s natural immortality; and when they had induced the people to receive this
error, they led them on to conclude that the sinner would
live in eternal misery. Now the prince of darkness, working through his agents, represents God as a revengeful
tyrant, declaring that He plunges into hell all those who do
not please Him, and causes them ever to feel His wrath; and
that while they suffer unutterable anguish, and writhe in the
eternal flames, their Creator looks down upon them with satisfaction.
Thus the arch-fiend clothes with his own attributes
the Creator and Benefactor of mankind. Cruelty is Satanic. God is love; and all that He created was pure, holy,

The

First

Great

Deception

[533-535]

311

and lovely, until sin was brought in by the first great rebel.
Satan himself is the enemy who tempts man to sin, and then
destroys him if he can; and when he has made sure of his
victim, then he exults in the ruin he has wrought. If permitted, he would sweep the entire race into his net. Were it not
for the interposition of divine power, not one son or daughter of Adam would escape.
He is seeking to overcome men to-day, as he overcame
our first parents, by shaking their confidence in their
Creator, and leading them to doubt the wisdom of His
government and the justice of His laws. Satan and his emissaries represent God as even worse than themselves, in order to excuse their own malignity and rebellion. The great
deceiver endeavors to shift his own horrible cruelty of character upon our heavenly Father, that he may cause himself to
appear as one greatly wronged because he will not submit to
so unjust a governor. He presents before the world the liberty which they may enjoy under his mild sway, in contrast
with the bondage imposed by the stern decrees of Jehovah.
Thus he succeeds in luring souls away from their allegiance
to God.
How repugnant to every emotion of love and mercy,
and even to our sense of justice, is the doctrine that the
wicked dead are tormented with fire and brimstone in
an eternally burning hell, that for the sins of a brief
earthly life they are to suffer torture as long as God shall
live. Yet this doctrine has been generally embodied in the
creeds of Christendom. Says a learned doctor of divinity:
“The sight of hell-torments will exalt the happiness of the
saints forever. When they see others who are of the same
nature and born under the same circumstances, plunged in
such misery, and they so distinguished, it will make them
sensible of how happy they are.” Another uses these words:
“While the decree of reprobation is eternally executing on
the vessels of wrath, the smoke of their torment will be eternally ascending in view of the vessels of mercy, who, instead
of taking the part of these miserable objects, will say, Amen,
Alleluia! praise ye the Lord!”

312

The

Great

Controversy

Where in the pages of God’s word are such sentiments
expressed? Those who present them may be learned and even
honest men; but they are deluded by the sophistry of Satan.
He leads them to misconstrue strong expressions of Scripture, giving to the language the coloring of bitterness and
malignity which pertains to himself, but not to our Creator.
What would be gained to God should we admit that
He delights in witnessing unceasing tortures; that He is
regaled with the groans and shrieks and imprecations of the
suffering creatures whom He holds in the flames of hell?
Can these horrid sounds be music in the ear of Infinite Love?
It is urged that the infliction of endless misery upon the
wicked would show God’s hatred of sin as an evil which is
ruinous to the peace and order of the universe. Oh, dreadful
blasphemy! As if God’s hatred of sin is the reason why He
perpetuates sin. For, according to the received theology, continued torture without hope of mercy maddens its wretched
victims, and as they pour out their rage in curses and blasphemy, they are forever augmenting their load of guilt. God’s
glory is not enhanced by thus perpetuating continually increasing sin through ceaseless ages.
It is beyond the power of the human mind to estimate
the evil which has been wrought by the heresy of eternal
torment. The religion of the Bible, full of love and goodness, and abounding in compassion, is darkened by superstition and clothed with terror. When we consider in
what false colors Satan has painted the character of God,
can we wonder that our merciful Creator is feared, dreaded,
and even hated? The appalling views of God which have
spread over the world from the teachings of the pulpit have
made thousands, yea, millions, of skeptics and infidels.
The theory of eternal torment is one of the false doctrines that constitute the wine of the abominations of
Babylon, of which she makes all nations drink. That ministers of Christ should have accepted this heresy and proclaimed it from the sacred desk, is indeed a mystery. They
received it from Rome, as they received the false Sabbath. True, it has been taught by great and good men; but

The

First

Great

Deception

[535-538]

313

the light on this subject had not come to them as it has come
to us. They were responsible only for the light which shone
in their time; we are accountable for that which shines in our
day. If we turn from the testimony of God’s word, and accept false doctrines because our fathers taught them, we fall
under the condemnation pronounced upon Babylon; we are
drinking of the wine of her abominations.
A large class to whom the doctrine of eternal torment
is revolting are driven to the opposite error. They see that
the Scriptures represent God as a being of love and compassion, and they cannot believe that He will consign His creatures to the fires of an eternally burning hell. But, holding
that the soul is naturally immortal, they see no alternative but to conclude that all mankind will finally be saved.
Many regard the threatenings of the Bible as designed merely
to frighten men into obedience, and not to be literally fulfilled. Thus the sinner can live in selfish pleasure, disregarding the requirements of God, and yet expect to be finally
received into His favor. Such a doctrine, presuming upon
God’s mercy, but ignoring His justice, pleases the carnal heart,
and emboldens the wicked in their iniquity.
To show how believers in universal salvation wrest
the Scriptures to sustain their soul-destroying dogmas,
it is needful only to cite their own utterances. At the funeral of an irreligious young man, who was killed instantly
by an accident, a Universalist minister selected as his text
the Scripture statement concerning David, “He was comforted
concerning Amnon, seeing he was dead.” 2 Samuel 13:39.
“I am frequently asked,” said the speaker, “what will be
the fate of those who leave the world in sin, die, perhaps, in
a state of inebriation, die with the scarlet stains of crime unwashed from their robes, or die as this young man died, having never made a profession or enjoyed an experience of religion. We are content with the Scriptures; their answer shall
solve the awful problem. Amnon was exceedingly sinful; he
was unrepentant, he was made drunk, and while drunk was
killed. David was a prophet of God; he must have known
whether it would be ill or well for Amnon in the world to

314

The

Great

Controversy

come. What were the expressions of his heart?—‘The soul
of King David longed to go forth unto Absalom; for he was
comforted concerning Amnon, seeing he was dead.’
“And what is the inference to be deduced from this language? Is it not that endless suffering formed no part of his
religious belief?—So we conceive; and here we discover a
triumphant argument in support of the more pleasing, more
enlightened, more benevolent hypothesis of ultimate universal purity and peace. He was comforted, seeing his son was
dead. And why so?—Because by the eye of prophecy he could
look forward into the glorious future, and see that son far
removed from all temptations, released from the bondage
and purified from the corruptions of sin, and after being made
sufficiently holy and enlightened, admitted to the assembly
of ascended and rejoicing spirits. His only comfort was, that
in being removed from the present state of sin and suffering,
his beloved son had gone where the loftiest breathings of the
Holy Spirit would be shed upon his darkened soul; where
his mind would be unfolded to the wisdom of Heaven and
the sweet raptures of immortal love, and thus prepared with
a sanctified nature to enjoy the rest and society of the heavenly inheritance.
“In these thoughts we would be understood to believe that
the salvation of Heaven depends upon nothing which we can
do in this life; neither upon a present change of heart, nor
upon present belief, or a present profession of religion.”
Thus does the professed minister of Christ reiterate
the falsehood uttered by the serpent in Eden,—“Ye shall
not surely die.” “In the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes
shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods.” The vilest of sinners,—the murderer, the thief, and the adulterer,—will after
death be prepared to enter into immortal bliss.
And from what does this perverter of the Scriptures
draw his conclusions?—From a single sentence expressing David’s submission to the dispensation of Providence.
His soul “longed to go forth unto Absalom; for he was comforted concerning Amnon, seeing he was dead.” The poignancy of his grief having been softened by time, his thoughts

The

First

Great

Deception

[538-540]

315

turned from the dead to the living son, self-banished through
fear of the just punishment of his crime. And this is the evidence that the incestuous, drunken Amnon was at death immediately transported to the abodes of bliss, there to be purified and prepared for the companionship of sinless angels!
A pleasing fable indeed, well suited to gratify the carnal heart!
This is Satan’s own doctrine, and it does his work effectually. Should we be surprised that, with such instruction, wickedness abounds? Is there not need of contending earnestly
for the faith once delivered to the saints?
The course pursued by this one false teacher illustrates
that of many others. A few words of Scripture are separated from the context, which would in many cases show
its meaning to be exactly opposite to the interpretation
put upon it; and such disjointed passages are perverted
and used in proof of doctrines that have no foundation
in the word of God. The testimony cited as evidence that
the drunken Amnon is in Heaven, is a mere inference, directly contradicted by the plain and positive statement of the
Scriptures, that no drunkard shall inherit the kingdom of God.
It is thus that doubters, unbelievers, and skeptics turn the
truth into a lie. And multitudes have been deceived by their
sophistry, and rocked to sleep in the cradle of carnal security.
If the souls of all men pass directly to Heaven at the
hour of dissolution, then we may well covet death rather
than life. Many have been led by this belief to put an end to
their existence. When overwhelmed with trouble, perplexity, and disappointment, it seems an easy thing to break the
brittle thread of life, and soar away into the bliss of the eternal world.
God has given in His word abundant evidence that
He will punish the transgressors of His law. Witness the
visitation of His judgments upon the angels who kept not
their first estate, on the inhabitants of the antediluvian world,
on the people of Sodom, on unbelieving Israel. Their history
is placed on record for our admonition.
Let us consider what the Bible teaches further con-

316

The

cerning the ungodly and unrepentant, whom the Universalist places in Heaven as holy, happy angels.
“I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end. I will
give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of
life freely.” This promise is only to those that thirst. None
but those who feel their need of the water of life, and seek it
at the loss of all things else, will be supplied. “He that
overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be his God,
and he shall be My son.” Revelation 21:6, 7. Here, also, conditions are specified. To inherit all things, we must resist
and overcome sin.
“No fornicator, nor unclean person, nor covetous man,
which is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of
Christ and God.” Ephesians 5:5, (Rev. Ver.). “Follow peace
with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall see
the Lord.” Hebrews 12:14. “Blessed are they that do His
commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life,
and may enter in through the gates into the city. For without
are dogs, and sorcerers, and whoremongers, and murderers,
and idolaters, and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie.” Revelation 22:14, 15.
God has given to men a declaration of His character:
“The Lord God, merciful and gracious, long-suffering, and
abundant in goodness and truth, keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, and that
will by no means clear the guilty.” Exodus 34:6, 7. The power
and authority of the divine government will be employed to
put down rebellion; yet all the manifestations of retributive
justice will be perfectly consistent with the character of God
as a merciful, long-suffering, benevolent being.
God does not force the will or judgment of any. He
takes no pleasure in a slavish obedience. He desires that
the creatures of His hands shall love Him because He is worthy of love. He would have them obey Him because they
have an intelligent appreciation of His wisdom, justice, and
benevolence. And all who have a just conception of these
qualities will love Him because they are drawn toward Him
in admiration of His attributes.

[540-543]

The principles of kindness, mercy, and love taught and
exemplified by our Saviour, are a copy of the will and
character of God. Christ declared that He taught nothing
except that which He had received from His Father. The principles of the divine government are in perfect harmony with
the Saviour’s precept, “Love your enemies.” God executes
justice upon the wicked, for the good of the universe, and
even of those upon whom His judgments are visited. He
would make them happy if He could do so in accordance
with the laws of His government and the justice of His character. He surrounds them with the tokens of His love, He
grants them a knowledge of His law, and follows them with
the offers of His mercy; but they despise His love, make
void His law, and reject His mercy. While constantly receiving His gifts, they dishonor the Giver; they hate God because they know that He abhors their sins. The Lord bears
long with their perversity; but the decisive hour will come at
last, when their destiny is to be decided. Will He then chain
these rebels to His side? Will He force them to do His will?
Those who have chosen Satan as their leader, and have
been controlled by his power, are not prepared to enter
the presence of God. Pride, deception, licentiousness, cruelty, have become fixed in their characters. Can they enter
Heaven to dwell forever with those whom they despised and
hated on earth? Truth will never be agreeable to a liar; meekness will not satisfy self-esteem and pride; purity is not acceptable to the corrupt; disinterested love does not appear
attractive to the selfish. The destiny of the wicked is fixed
by their own choice. Their exclusion from Heaven is voluntary; it is just.
Like the waters of the flood, the fires of the great day
declare God’s verdict that the wicked are incurable. They
have no disposition to submit to divine authority. Their will
has been exercised in revolt; and when life is ended, it is too
late to turn the current of their thoughts in the opposite direction,—too late to turn from transgression to obedience,
from hatred to love.
In mercy to the world, God blotted out its wicked in-

habitants in Noah’s time. In mercy He destroyed the corrupt dwellers in Sodom. Through the deceptive power of
Satan, the workers of iniquity obtain sympathy and admiration, and are thus constantly leading others to rebellion. It
was so in Noah’s day, and in the time of Abraham and Lot; it
is so in our time. It is in mercy to the universe that God will
finally destroy the rejecters of His grace.
But the doctrine of never-ending torment has no sanction in the Bible. John in the Revelation, describing the future joy and glory of the redeemed, declares that He heard
every voice in Heaven and earth, and under the earth, ascribing praise to God. There will be no lost beings in hell to
mingle their shrieks with the songs of the saved.
“The wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.” Romans 6:23.
While life is the inheritance of the righteous, death is the
portion of the wicked. The penalty threatened is not merely
temporal death, for all must suffer this. It is the second death,
the opposite of everlasting life. God cannot save the sinner
in his sins; but He declares that the wicked, having suffered
the punishment of their guilt, shall be as though they had not
been. Says an inspired writer, “Thou shalt diligently consider his place, and it shall not be.” Psalm 37:10. In consequence of Adam’s sin, death passed upon all mankind. All
alike go down into the grave. But through the provisions of
the plan of salvation, all are to be brought forth from their
graves. Then those who have not secured the pardon of their
sins must receive the penalty of transgression. They suffer
punishment varying in duration and intensity according to
their works, but finally ending in the second death. Covered
with infamy, they sink into hopeless, eternal oblivion.
Upon the fundamental error of natural immortality
rests the doctrine of consciousness in death, a doctrine,
like eternal torment, opposed to the teachings of the
Scriptures, to the dictates of reason, and to our feelings
of humanity. According to the popular belief, the redeemed
in Heaven are acquainted with all that takes place on the
earth, and especially with the lives of the friends whom they

The

First

Great

Deception

[543-546]

319

have left behind. But how could it be a source of happiness
to the dead to know the troubles of the living, to witness the
sins committed by their own loved ones, and to see them
enduring all the sorrows, disappointments, and anguish of
life? How much of Heaven’s bliss would be enjoyed by those
who were hovering over their friends on earth? And how
utterly revolting is the belief that as soon as the breath leaves
the body, the soul of the impenitent is consigned to the flames
of hell! To what depths of anguish must those be plunged
who see their friends passing to the grave unprepared, to
enter upon an eternity of woe and sin! Many have been driven
to insanity by this harrowing thought.
What say the Scriptures concerning these things?
David declares that man is not conscious in death. “His
breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that very day
his thoughts perish.” Psalm 146:4. Solomon bears the same
testimony: “The living know that they shall die; but the dead
know not anything.” “Their love, and their hatred, and their
envy, is now perished; neither have they any more a portion
forever in anything that is done under the sun.” “There is no
work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave,
whither thou goest.” Ecclesiastes 9:5, 6. 10.
When, in answer to his prayer, Hezekiah’s life was prolonged fifteen years, the grateful king rendered to God a tribute of praise for His great mercy. In this song he tells the
reason why he thus rejoices: “The grave cannot praise thee;
death cannot celebrate thee; they that go down into the pit
cannot hope for thy truth. The living, the living, he shall
praise thee, as I do this day. The father to the children shall
make known thy truth.” Isaiah 38:18, 19. Popular theology
represents the righteous dead as in Heaven, entered into bliss,
and praising God with an immortal tongue; but Hezekiah
could see no such glorious prospect in death. With his words
agrees the testimony of the psalmist: “In death there is no
remembrance of Thee; in the grave who shall give Thee
thanks?” “The dead praise not the Lord, neither any that go
down into silence.” Psalm 6:5; 115:17.
Peter, speaking through the Holy Spirit on the day of Pen-

tecost, said: “Men and brethren, let me freely speak unto
you of the patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried,
and his sepulcher is with us unto this day.” “For David is not
ascended into the heavens.” Acts 2:29, 34. The fact that David
remains in the grave until the resurrection proves that the
righteous do not go to Heaven at death. It is only through the
resurrection, and by virtue of the fact that Christ has risen,
that David can at last sit at the right hand of God.
Paul declares: “If the dead rise not, then is not Christ
raised. And if Christ be not raised, your faith is vain; ye are
yet in your sins. Then they also which are fallen asleep in
Christ are perished.” 1 Corinthians 15:16-18. If for four
thousand years the righteous had gone directly to Heaven
at death, how could they be said to perish, even though
there should never be a resurrection?
When about to leave His disciples, Jesus did not tell
them that they would soon come to Him. “I go to prepare
a place for you,” He said. “And if I go and prepare a place
for you, I will come again, and receive you unto Myself.”
John 14:2, 3. And Paul tells us, further, that “the Lord Himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice
of the archangel, and with the trump of God; and the dead in
Christ shall rise first. Then we which are alive and remain
shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet
the Lord in the air; and so shall we ever be with the Lord.”
And he adds, “Comfort one another with these words.” 1
Thessalonians 4:16-18. How wide the contrast between these
words of comfort and those of the minister previously quoted.
The latter consoled the bereaved friends with the assurance,
that, however sinful the dead might have been, he was received among the angels as soon as he breathed out his life
here. Paul points his brethren to the future coming of the
Lord, when the fetters of the tomb shall be broken, and the
“dead in Christ” shall be raised to eternal life.
Before any can enter the mansions of the blest, their
cases must be investigated, and their characters and their
deeds must pass in review before God. All are to be judged
according to the things written in the books, and to be re-

[546-550]

321

warded as their works have been. This Judgment does not
take place at death. Mark the words of Paul: “He hath appointed a day, in the which He will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom He hath ordained; whereof He
hath given assurance unto all men, in that He hath raised
him from the dead.” Acts 17:31. Here the apostle plainly
stated that a specified time, then future, had been fixed
upon for the Judgment of the world.
Jude refers to the same period: “The angels which kept
not their first estate, but left their own habitation, He hath
reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the Judgment of the great day.” And again he quotes the words of
Enoch: “Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thousands of His
saints, to execute judgment upon all.” Jude 6, 14, 15. John
declares that he “saw the dead, small and great, stand before
God, and the books were opened;” “and the dead were judged
out of those things which were written in the books.” Revelation 20:12.
But if the dead are already enjoying the bliss of Heaven
or writhing in the flames of hell, what need of a future
Judgment? The teachings of God’s word on these important points are neither obscure nor contradictory; they may
be understood by common minds. But what candid mind can
see either wisdom or justice in the current theory? Will the
righteous, after the investigation of their cases at the Judgment, receive the commendation, “Well done, good and faithful servant, enter thou into the joy of thy Lord,” when they
have been dwelling in His presence, perhaps for long ages?
Are the wicked summoned from the place of torment to receive the sentence from the Judge of all the earth, “Depart,
ye cursed, into everlasting fire”? Oh, solemn mockery!
shameful impeachment of the wisdom and justice of God!
Nowhere in the Sacred Scriptures is found the statement that the righteous go to their reward or the wicked
to their punishment at death. The patriarchs and prophets
have left no such assurance. Christ and His apostles have
given no hint of it. The Bible clearly teaches that the dead do
not go immediately to Heaven. They are represented as sleep-

ing until the resurrection. In the very day that the silver cord
is loosed and the golden bowl broken, man’s thoughts perish. They that go down to the grave are in silence. They know
no more of anything that is done under the sun. Blessed rest
for the weary righteous! Time, be it long or short, is but
a moment to them. They sleep, they are awakened by the
trump of God to a glorious immortality. As they are called
forth from their deep slumber, they begin to think just
where they ceased. The last sensation was the pang of death,
the last thought that they were falling beneath the power of
the grave. When they arise from the tomb, their first glad
thought will be echoed in the triumphal shout, “O death,
where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?”

The doctrine of natural immortality has prepared the
way for modern Spiritualism. If the dead are admitted
to the presence of God and holy angels, and privileged
with knowledge far exceeding what they before possessed, why should they not return to the earth to enlighten and instruct the living? How can those who believe in man’s consciousness in death reject what comes
to them as divine light communicated by glorified spirits? Here is a channel regarded as sacred, through which Satan
works for the accomplishment of his purposes. The fallen
angels who do his bidding appear as messengers from the
spirit world. While professing to bring the living into communication with the dead, Satan exercises his bewitching
influence upon their minds.
He has power even to bring before men the appearance of their departed friends. The counterfeit is perfect; the familiar look, the words, the tone, are reproduced with marvelous distinctness. Many are comforted
with the assurance that their loved ones are enjoying the bliss

324

The

Controversy

of Heaven; and without suspicion of danger, they give ear to
seducing spirits and doctrines of devils.
When they have been led to believe that the dead actually return to communicate with them, Satan causes
those to appear who went into the grave unprepared.
They claim to be happy in Heaven, and even to occupy
exalted positions there; and thus the error is widely taught,
that no difference is made between the righteous and the
wicked. The pretended visitants from the world of spirits
sometimes utter cautions and warnings which prove to be
correct. Then, as confidence is gained, they present doctrines which directly undermine faith in the Scriptures.
With an appearance of deep interest in the well-being of their
friends on earth, they insinuate the most dangerous errors.
The fact that they state some truths, and are able at times to
foretell future events, gives to their statements an appearance of reliability; and their false teachings are accepted by
the multitudes as readily, and believed as implicitly, as if
they were the most sacred truths of the Bible. The law of
God is set aside, the Spirit of grace despised, the blood
of the covenant counted an unholy thing. The spirits deny
the divinity of Christ, and place even the Creator on a level
with themselves. Thus under a new disguise the great rebel
still carries forward his warfare against God, begun in
Heaven, and for nearly six thousand years continued upon
the earth.
Many endeavor to account for spiritual manifestations
by attributing them wholly to fraud and sleight of hand
on the part of the medium. But while it is true that the
results of trickery have often been palmed off as genuine
manifestations, there have been, also, marked exhibitions
of supernatural power. The mysterious rapping with which
modern Spiritualism began was not the result of human trickery or cunning, but the direct work of evil angels, who thus
introduced one of the most successful of soul-destroying
delusions. Many will be ensnared through the belief that Spiritualism is a merely human imposture; when brought face to
face with manifestations which they cannot but regard as

Spiritualism

[552-554]

325

supernatural, they will be deceived, and will be led to accept
them as the great power of God.
These persons overlook the testimony of the Scriptures concerning the wonders wrought by Satan and his
agents. It was by Satanic aid that Pharaoh’s magicians
were enabled to counterfeit the work of God. The apostle
John, describing the miracle-working power that will be manifested in the last days, declares: “He doeth great wonders, so
that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth in
the sight of men, and deceiveth them that dwell on the earth
by the means of those miracles which he had power to do.”
Revelation 13:13, 14. No mere impostures are here brought
to view. Men are deceived by the miracles which Satan’s
agents have power to do, not which they pretend to do.
The very name of witchcraft is now held in contempt.
The claim that men can hold intercourse with evil spirits is
regarded as a fable of the Dark Ages. But Spiritualism,
which numbers its converts by hundreds of thousands,
yea, by millions, which has made its way into scientific
circles, which has invaded churches, and has found favor in legislative bodies, and even in the courts of kings—
this mammoth deception is but a revival in a new disguise of
the witchcraft condemned and prohibited of old.
Satan beguiles men now, as he beguiled Eve in Eden,
by exciting a desire to obtain forbidden knowledge. “Ye
shall be as gods,” he declares, “knowing good and evil.” But
the wisdom which Spiritualism imparts is that described by
the apostle James, which “descendeth not from above, but is
earthly, sensual, devilish.” James 3:15.
The prince of darkness has a masterly mind, and he
skillfully adapts his temptations to men of every variety
of condition and culture. He works “with all deceivableness
of unrighteousness” to gain control of the children of men;
but he can accomplish his object only as they voluntarily
yield to his temptations. Those who place themselves in his
power by indulging their evil traits of character, little realize
where their course will end. The tempter accomplishes their
ruin, and then employs them to ruin others.

326

The

Great

Controversy

To those who regard themselves as educated and refined, Satan addresses himself by exciting the imagination to lofty flights in forbidden fields, leading them to
take so great pride in their superior wisdom that in their
hearts they despise the Eternal One. To this class the great
deceiver presents Spiritualism in its more refined and intellectual aspects, and he thus succeeds in drawing many into
his snare. He who could appear clothed with the brightness of the heavenly seraphs before Christ in the wilderness of temptation, comes to men in the most attractive
manner, as an angel of light. He appeals to the reason by
the presentation of elevating themes, he delights the fancy
with enrapturing scenes, and he enlists the affections by his
eloquent portrayals of love and charity. That mighty being
who could take the world’s Redeemer to an exceedingly high
mountain, and bring before Him all the kingdoms of the earth
and the glory of them, will present his temptations to men in
a manner to pervert the senses of all who are not shielded by
divine power.
To the self-indulgent, the pleasure-loving, the sensual,
the grosser forms of Spiritualism are adapted; and multitudes eagerly accept teachings that leave them at liberty to follow the inclinations of the carnal heart. Satan
studies every indication of the frailty of human nature, he
marks the sins which each individual is inclined to commit,
and then he takes care that opportunities shall not be wanting to gratify the tendency to evil. He tempts men to excess
in that which is in itself lawful, causing them through intemperance to weaken physical, mental, and moral power. He
has destroyed and is destroying thousands through the indulgence of the passions, thus brutalizing the entire nature
of man. When the people are led to believe that desire is the highest law, that liberty is license, and that
man is accountable only to himself, who can wonder
that corruption and depravity teem on every hand?
The reins of self-control are laid upon the neck of lust, the
powers of mind and soul are made subject to the animal
propensities, and Satan exultingly sweeps into his net thou-

Spiritualism

[554-559]

327

sands who profess to be followers of Christ.
But none need be deceived by the lying claims of
Spiritualism. God has given the world sufficient light
to enable them to discover the snare. If there were
no other evidence, it should be enough for the Christian that the spirits make no difference between righteousness and sin, between the noblest and purest of the
apostles of Christ and the most corrupt of the servants of
Satan. By representing the basest of men as in Heaven,
and highly exalted there, Satan virtually declares to the world,
No matter how wicked you are; no matter whether you
believe or disbelieve God and the Bible. Live as you please;
Heaven is your home.
Moreover, the apostles, as personated by these lying
spirits, are made to contradict what they wrote at the
dictation of the Holy Spirit when on earth. They deny the
divine origin of the Bible, and thus tear away the foundation
of the Christian’s hope, and put out the light that reveals the
way to Heaven.
Satan is making the world believe that the Bible is a
mere fiction, or at least a book suited to the infancy of
the race, but now to be lightly regarded, or cast aside as
obsolete. And to take the place of the word of God he
holds out spiritual manifestations. Here is a channel wholly
under his control; by this means he can make the world believe what he will. The book that is to judge him and his
followers he puts into the shade, just where he wants it; the
Saviour of the world he makes to be no more than a common
man. And as the Romish guard that watched the tomb of
Jesus spread the lying report which the priests and elders
put into their mouths to disprove His resurrection, so do the
believers in spiritual manifestations try to make it appear
that there is nothing miraculous in the circumstances of our
Saviour’s life. After thus seeking to put Jesus in the background, they call attention to their own miracles, declaring
that these far exceed the works of Christ.
Says the prophet Isaiah: “When they shall say unto you,
Seek unto them that have familiar spirits, and unto wizards

328

The

Great

Controversy

that peep and that mutter: should not a people seek unto
their God? for the living to the dead? To the law and to the
testimony. If they speak not according to this word, it is
because there is no light in them.” Isaiah 8:19, 20. If men
had been willing to receive the truth so plainly stated
in the Scriptures, that the dead know not anything,
they would see in the claims and manifestations of
Spiritualism the working of Satan with power and signs
and lying wonders. But rather than yield the liberty
so agreeable to the carnal heart, and renounce the
sins which they love, the multitudes close their eyes
to the light, and walk straight on, regardless of warnings, while Satan weaves his snares about them, and
they become his prey. “Because they received not the
love of the truth, that they might be saved,” therefore “God
shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a
lie.” 2 Thessalonians 2:10, 11.
Those who oppose the teachings of Spiritualism are
assailing, not men alone, but Satan and his angels. They
have entered upon a contest against principalities and powers and wicked spirits in high places. Satan will not yield
one inch of ground except as he is driven back by the power
of heavenly messengers. The people of God should be able
to meet him, as did our Saviour, with the words, “It is
written.” Satan can quote Scripture now as in the days of
Christ, and he will pervert its teachings to sustain his delusions. But the plain statements of the Bible will furnish
weapons powerful in every conflict.
Those who would stand in this time of peril must understand the testimony of the Scriptures concerning the
nature of man and the state of the dead; for in the near
future many will be confronted by the spirits of devils personating beloved relatives or friends, and declaring the most
dangerous heresies. These visitants will appeal to our
tenderest sympathies, and will work miracles to sustain their
pretensions. We must be prepared to withstand them with
the Bible truth that the dead know not anything, and that
they who thus appear are the spirits of devils.

Spiritualism

[559-561]

329

Just before us is the “hour of temptation, which shall
come upon all the world, to try them that dwell upon the
earth.” Revelation 3:10. All whose faith is not firmly
established upon the word of God will be deceived
and overcome. But to those who earnestly seek a knowledge of the truth, thus doing what they can to prepare for
the conflict, the God of truth will be a sure defense. “Because thou hast kept the word of My patience, I also will
keep thee,” is the Saviour’s promise. He would sooner
send every angel out of Heaven to protect His people,
than leave one soul that trusts in Him to be overcome by Satan.
The prophet Isaiah brings to view the fearful deception which will come upon the wicked, causing them to
count themselves secure from the judgments of God: “We
have made a covenant with death, and with hell are we at
agreement. When the overflowing scourge shall pass through,
it shall not come unto us; for we have made lies our refuge,
and under falsehood have we hid ourselves.” Isaiah 28:15.
In the class here described are included those who in their
stubborn impenitence comfort themselves with the assurance
that there is to be no punishment for the sinner; that all mankind, it matters not how corrupt, are to be exalted to Heaven
to become as the angels of God. But still more emphatically
are those making a covenant with death and an agreement
with hell, who renounce the truths which Heaven has provided as a defense for the righteous in the day of trouble, and
accept the refuge of lies offered by Satan in its stead,—the
delusive pretensions of Spiritualism.
Marvelous beyond expression is the blindness of the
people of this generation. Thousands reject the word of
God as unworthy of belief, and with eager confidence
receive the deceptions of Satan. Skeptics and scoffers with
great clamor denounce the bigotry of those who contend for
the faith of prophets and apostles, and they divert themselves
by holding up to ridicule the solemn declarations of the Scriptures concerning Christ and the plan of salvation, and the
retribution to be visited upon the rejecters of the truth. They

330

The

Great

Controversy

affect great pity for minds so narrow, weak, and superstitious as to acknowledge the claims of God, and obey the
requirements of His law. They manifest as much assurance as if, indeed, they had made a covenant with
death and an agreement with hell,—as if they had
erected an impassable, impenetrable barrier between
themselves and the vengeance of God. Nothing can
arouse their fears. So fully have they yielded to the
tempter, so closely are they united with him, and so thoroughly imbued with his spirit, that they have no power and
no inclination to break away from his snare.
Long has Satan been preparing for his final effort
to deceive the world. The foundation of his work was
laid by the assurance given to Eve in Eden, “Ye shall not
surely die.” “In the day that ye eat thereof, then your eyes
shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and
evil.” Little by little he has prepared the way for his
master-piece of deception in the development of Spiritualism. He has not yet reached the full accomplishment of his designs; but it will be reached in the last
remnant of time, and the world will be swept into the
ranks of this delusion. They are fast being lulled into a
fatal security, to be awakened only by the outpouring of the
wrath of God.
Saith the Lord God: “Judgment also will I lay to the line,
and righteousness to the plummet; and the hail shall sweep
away the refuge of lies, and the waters shall overflow the
hiding place. And your covenant with death shall be disannulled, and your agreement with hell shall not stand. When
the overflowing scourge shall pass through, then ye shall be
trodden down by it." Isaiah 28:17,18.

so widely upon vital points as has been supposed, and
that a little concession on our part will bring us into a
better understanding with Rome. The time was when Protestants placed a high value upon the liberty of conscience
which has been so dearly purchased. They taught their children to abhor popery, and held that to remain at peace with
Rome would be disloyalty to God. But how widely different
are the sentiments now expressed.
The defenders of popery declare that she has been maligned; and the Protestant world is inclined to accept the
statement. Many urge that it is unjust to judge the Romish
Church of to-day by the abominations and absurdities that
marked her reign during the centuries of ignorance and darkness. They excuse her horrible cruelty as the result of the
barbarism of the times, and plead that civilization has
changed her sentiments.

332

The

Great

Controversy

Have these persons forgotten the claim of infallibility
for eight hundred years put forth by this haughty power?
So far from relinquishing this claim, the church in the nineteenth century has affirmed it with greater positiveness than
ever before. As Rome asserts that she has never erred, and
never can err, how can she renounce the principles which
governed her course in past ages?
The papal church will never relinquish her claim to
infallibility. All that she has done in her persecution of
those who reject her dogmas, she holds to be right; and
would she not repeat the same acts, should the opportunity be presented? Let the restraints now imposed by secular governments be removed, and Rome be re-instated in her
former power, and there would speedily be a revival of her
tyranny and persecution.
It is true that there are real Christians in the Roman
Catholic communion. Thousands in that church are serving God according to the best light they have. They are
not allowed access to His word, and therefore they do not
discern the truth. They have never seen the contrast between
a living heart-service and a round of mere forms and ceremonies. But God looks with pitying tenderness upon these
souls, educated as they are in a faith that is delusive and
unsatisfying. He will cause rays of light to penetrate the dense
darkness that surrounds them. He will reveal to them the
truth as it is in Jesus, and they will yet take their position
with His people.
But Romanism as a system is no more in harmony
with the gospel of Christ now than at any former period
in her history. The Protestant churches are in great darkness, or they would discern the signs of the times. The
Roman Church is far-reaching in her plans and modes of
operation. She is employing every device to extend her influence and increase her power in preparation for a fierce
and determined conflict to regain control of the world, to reestablish persecution, and to undo all that Protestantism has
done. Catholicism is gaining ground in our country upon
every side. Look at the number of her churches and chapels.

Character and Aims of the Papacy

[563-567]

333

Look at her colleges and seminaries, so widely patronized
by Protestants. These things should awaken the anxiety of
all who prize the pure principles of the gospel.
Protestants have tampered with and patronized popery; they have made compromises and concessions which
papists themselves are surprised to see, and fail to understand. Men are closing their eyes to the real character of
Romanism, and the dangers to be apprehended from her supremacy. The people of our land need to be aroused to resist
the advances of this most dangerous foe to civil and religious liberty.
Many suppose that the Catholic religion is unattractive, and that its worship is a dull, stupid round of ceremony. Here they mistake. While Romanism is based upon
deception, it is not a coarse and clumsy imposture. The religious service of the Romanish Church is a most impressive
ceremonial. Its gorgeous display and solemn rites fascinate
the senses of the people, and silence the voice of reason and
of conscience. The eye is charmed. Magnificent churches,
imposing processions, golden altars, jeweled shrines, choice
paintings, and exquisite sculpture appeal to the love of beauty.
The ear also is captivated. There is nothing to excel the music. The rich notes of the deep-toned organ, blending with
the melody of many voices as it swells through the lofty
domes and pillared aisles of her grand cathedrals, cannot
fail to impress the mind with awe and reverence.
This outward splendor, pomp, and ceremony, that only
mocks the longings of the sin-sick soul, is an evidence of
inward corruption. The religion of Christ needs not such
attractions to recommend it. In the light shining from the
cross, true Christianity appears so pure and lovely that external decorations only hide its true worth. It is the beauty of
holiness, a meek and quiet spirit, which is of value with God.
Brilliancy of style is not an index of pure, elevated thought.
The highest conceptions of art, the most delicate refinement
of taste, often spring from minds wholly earthly and sensual. They are often employed by Satan to lead men to forget
the necessities of the soul, to lose sight of the future, immor-

tal life, to turn away from their infinite Helper, and to live
for this world alone.
A religion of externals is attractive to the unrenewed
heart. The pomp and ceremony of the Catholic worship
have a seductive, bewitching power by which many are
deceived; and they come to look upon the Roman Church as
the very gate of Heaven. None are proof against her influence but those who have planted their feet firmly upon the
foundation of truth, and whose hearts are renewed by the
Spirit of God. Thousands who have not an experimental
knowledge of Christ will be swept into this deception. A form
of godliness without the power is just what they desire. The
Romanist feels at liberty to sin, because the church claims
the right to pardon. To him who loves self-indulgence, it is
more pleasing to confess to a fellow-mortal than to open the
soul to God. It is more palatable to human nature to do penance than to renounce sin. It is easier to mortify the flesh by
sackcloth and nettles and galling chains than to crucify fleshly
lusts. Heavy is the yoke which the carnal heart is willing to
bear rather than bow to the yoke of Christ.
There is a striking similarity between the church of
Rome and the Jewish church at the time of Christ’s first
advent. While the Jews secretly trampled upon every principle of the law of God, they were outwardly rigorous in the
observance of its precepts, loading it down with exactions
and traditions that made obedience painful and burdensome.
As the Jews professed to revere the law, so do Romanists
claim to reverence the cross. They exalt the symbol of Christ’s
sufferings, while in their lives they deny Him whom it represents.
Papists place crosses upon their churches, upon their
altars, and upon their garments. Everywhere is seen the
insignia of the cross. Everywhere it is outwardly honored
and exalted. But the teachings of Christ are buried beneath a mass of senseless traditions, false interpretations,
and rigorous exactions. The Saviour’s words concerning
the bigoted Jews apply with still greater force to the Romish
leaders: “They bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne,

Character and Aims of the Papacy

[567-569]

335

and lay them on men’s shoulders; but they themselves will
not move them with one of their fingers.” Matthew 23:4.
Conscientious souls are kept in constant terror, fearing
the wrath of an offended God, while the dignitaries of
the church are living in luxury and sensual pleasure.
Satan instigates the worship of images, the invocation
of saints, and the exaltation of the pope, to attract the
minds of the people from God and from His Son. To accomplish their ruin, he endeavors to turn their attention from
Him through whom alone they can find salvation. He will
direct them to any one that can be substituted for the One
who has said, “Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy
laden, and I will give you rest.” Matthew 11:28.
It is Satan’s constant effort to misrepresent the character of God, the nature of sin, and the real issues at
stake in the great controversy. By his sophistry he blinds
the minds of men, and secures them as his agents to war
against God. By perverted conceptions of the divine attributes, heathen nations were led to believe human sacrifices necessary to secure the favor of Deity; and the most
horrible cruelties have been perpetrated under the various
forms of idolatry. The Romish Church, uniting the forms of
paganism and Christianity, and in a similar manner misrepresenting the character of God, has resorted to practices no
less cruel and revolting. In the days of Rome’s supremacy
there were instruments of torture to compel assent to her
doctrines. There was the stake for those who would not
concede to her claims. There were massacres on a scale
that will never be known to mortals. Dignitaries of the
church studied, under Satan their master, to invent means to
cause the greatest possible torture, and not end the life of
their victim. The infernal process was repeated to the utmost
limit of human endurance, until nature gave up the struggle,
and the sufferer hailed death as a sweet release.
Such was the fate of Rome’s opponents. For her adherents she had the discipline of the scourge, of famishing hunger, of bodily austerities in every conceivable,
heart-sickening form. To secure the favor of Heaven, peni-

336

The

tents violated the laws of God by violating the laws of nature. They were taught to sunder every tie which He has
formed to bless and gladden man’s earthly sojourn. The
churchyard contains millions of victims who spent their lives
in vain endeavors to subdue their natural affections, to repress, as offensive to God, every thought and feeling of sympathy with their fellow-creatures.
If we desire to understand the determined cruelty of
Satan, manifested for hundreds of years, not among those
who never heard of God, but in the very heart and
throughout the extent of Christendom, we have only to
look at the history of Romanism. And as we see how he
succeeds in disguising himself, and accomplishing his work
through the leaders of the church, we may better understand
why he has so great antipathy to the Bible. If that book is
read, the mercy and love of God will be revealed; it will be
seen that he lays upon men none of these heavy burdens. All
that he asks is a broken and contrite heart, a humble, obedient spirit.
Christ gives no example in His life for men and women
to shut themselves in monasteries in order to become fitted for Heaven. He has never taught that love and sympathy must be repressed. The Saviour’s heart overflowed
with love. The nearer man approaches to moral perfection,
the keener are his sensibilities, the more acute is his perception of sin, and the deeper his sympathy for the afflicted.
The pope claims to be the vicar of Christ. How does his
character bear comparison with that of our Saviour?
Was Christ ever known to consign men to the prison or
the rack because they did not pay Him homage as the
King of Heaven? Was His voice heard condemning to death
those who did not accept Him? When He was slighted by the
people of a Samaritan village, the apostle John was filled
with indignation, and inquired, “Lord, wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven, and consume them,
even as Elias did?” Jesus looked with pity upon His disciple,
and rebuked his harsh spirit, saying, “The Son of man is not
come to destroy men’s lives, but to save them.” Luke 9:54,

Character and Aims of the Papacy

[569-571]

337

56. How different from the spirit manifested by Christ is
that of his professed vicar.
The Romish Church now presents a fair front to the
world, covering with apologies her record of horrible
cruelties. She has clothed herself in Christlike garments;
but she is unchanged. Every principle of popery that
existed in ages past exists to-day. The doctrines devised in
the darkest ages are still held. Let none deceive themselves.
The popery that Protestants are now so ready to embrace
and honor is the same that ruled the world in the days of the
Reformation, when men of God stood up at the peril of their
lives to expose her iniquity. She possesses the same pride
and arrogant assumption that lorded it over kings and princes,
and claimed the prerogatives of God. Her spirit is no less
cruel and despotic now than when she crushed out human
liberty, and slew the saints of the Most High.
Popery is just what prophecy declared that she would
be,—the apostasy of the latter times. It is a part of her
policy to assume the character which will best accomplish her purpose; but beneath the variable appearance
of the chameleon, she conceals the invariable venom of
the serpent. “We are not bound to keep faith and promises
to heretics,” she declares. Shall this power, whose record for
a thousand years is written in the blood of the saints, be now
acknowledged as a part of the church of Christ?
It is not without reason that the claim has been put
forth that Catholicism is now almost like Protestantism.
There has been a change; but the change is in Protestants, not in Romanists. Catholicism indeed resembles the
Protestantism that now exists; but it is far removed from
Protestantism as it was in the days of Cranmer, Ridley, Knox,
and other reformers.
As the Protestant churches have been seeking the favor of the world, false charity has blinded their eyes.
They do not see but that it is right to believe good of all
evil; and as the inevitable result, they will finally believe
evil of all good. Instead of standing in defense of the faith
once delivered to the saints, they are now, as it were, apolo-

338

The

Controversy

gizing to Rome for their uncharitable opinion of her, begging pardon for their bigotry.
A large class, even of those who look upon Romanism
with no favor, apprehend little danger from her power
and influence. Many urge that the intellectual and moral
darkness prevailing during the Middle Ages favored the
spread of her dogmas, superstitions, and oppression, and that
the greater intelligence of modern times, the general diffusion of knowledge, and the increasing liberality in matters
of religion, forbid a revival of intolerance and tyranny. The
very thought that such a state of things will exist in this enlightened age is ridiculed. It is true that great light, intellectual, moral, and religious, is shining upon this generation. In
the open pages of God’s holy word, light from Heaven has
been shed upon the world. But it should be remembered that
the greater the light bestowed, the greater the darkness of
those who pervert or reject it.
A prayerful study of the Bible would show Protestants
the real character of the papacy, and would cause them
to abhor and to shun it; but men are so wise in their own
conceit that they feel no need of humbly seeking God that
they may be led into the truth. Although priding themselves on their enlightenment, they are ignorant both of the
Scriptures and of the power of God. They must have some
means of quieting their consciences; and they seek that which
is least spiritual and humiliating. What they desire is a
method of forgetting God which shall pass as a method
of remembering Him. The papacy is well adapted to meet
the wants of all these. It is prepared for two classes of
mankind, embracing nearly the whole world,—those who
would be saved by their merits, and those who would be
saved in their sins. Here is the secret of its power.
A day of great intellectual darkness has been shown
to be favorable to the success of popery. It will yet be
demonstrated that a day of great intellectual light is
equally favorable for its success. In past ages, when men
were without God’s word, and without the knowledge of the
truth, their eyes were blindfolded, and thousands were en-

Character and Aims of the Papacy

[572-574]

339

snared, not seeing the net spread for their feet. In this generation there are many whose eyes become dazzled by the
glare of human speculations, “science falsely so called;” they
discern not the net, and walk into it as readily as if blindfolded. God designed that man’s intellectual powers should
be held as a gift from his Maker, and employed in the service
of truth and righteousness; but when they are idolized, and
laid upon the shrine of Satan to be employed in the service
of a false religion, then intelligence can accomplish greater
harm than ignorance.
In the movements now in progress in this country to
secure for the institutions and usages of the church the
support of the State, Protestants are following in the steps
of papists. Nay, more, they are opening the door for popery
to regain in Protestant America the supremacy which she
has lost in the Old World. And that which gives greater significance to this movement is the fact that the principal object contemplated is the enforcement of Sunday observance,—a custom which originated with Rome, and which
she claims as the sign of her authority.
The spirit of the papacy,—the spirit of conformity to
worldly customs, the veneration for human traditions
above the commands of God,—is permeating the Protestant churches, and leading them on to do the same work
of Sunday exaltation which the papacy has done before
them. Would the reader understand the agencies to be employed in the soon-coming contest? He has but to trace the
record of the means which Rome employed for the same object in ages past. Would he know how papists and Protestants united will deal with those who reject their dogmas?
Let him see the spirit which Rome manifested toward the
Sabbath and its defenders.
Royal edicts, human councils, and church ordinances
sustained by secular power, were the steps by which the
pagan festival attained its position of honor in the Christian world. The first public measure enforcing Sunday
observance was the law enacted [A.D. 321] by Constantine, two years before his profession of Christianity. This

340

The

Great

Controversy

edict required towns-people to rest on the venerable day of
the sun, but permitted countrymen to continue their agricultural pursuits. Though originally a heathen statute, it was
enforced by the emperor after his nominal acceptance of the
Christian religion.
The royal mandate not proving a sufficient substitute
for divine authority, the bishop of Rome soon after conferred upon the Sunday the title of Lord’s day. Another
bishop, who also sought the favor of princes, and who was
the special friend and flatterer of Constantine, advanced the
claim that Christ had transferred the Sabbath to Sunday. Not
a single testimony of the Scriptures was produced in proof
of the new doctrine. The sacred garments in which the spurious Sabbath was arrayed were of man’s own manufacture;
but they served to embolden men in trampling upon the law
of God. All who desired to be honored by the world accepted
the popular festival.
As the papacy became firmly established, the work of
Sunday exaltation was continued. For a time the people
engaged in agricultural labor when not attending church,
and the name Sabbath was still attached to the seventh
day. But steadily and surely a change was effected. Those
in holy office were forbidden to pass judgment in any civil
controversy on the Sunday. Soon after, persons of all rank
were commanded to refrain from common labor, on pain of
a fine for freemen, and stripes in the case of servants. Later
it was decreed that rich men should be punished with the
loss of half of their estates; and finally, that if still obstinate
they should be made slaves. The lower classes were to suffer
perpetual banishment.
Miracles also were called into requisition. Among other
wonders it was reported that as a husbandman who was about
to plow his field on Sunday, cleaned his plow with an iron,
the iron stuck fast in his hand, and for two years he carried it
about with him, “to his exceeding great pain and shame.”
Later, the pope gave directions that the parish priest should
admonish the violators of Sunday, and wish them to go to
church and say their prayers, lest they bring some great ca-

Character and Aims of the Papacy

[574-576]

341

lamity on themselves and neighbors. An ecclesiastical council brought forward the argument since so widely employed,
that because persons had been struck by lightning while laboring on Sunday, it must be the Sabbath. “It is apparent,”
said the prelates, “how high the displeasure of God was upon
their neglect of this day.” An appeal was then made that
priests and ministers, kings and princes, and all faithful
people, “use their utmost endeavors and care that the day be
restored to its honor, and, for the credit of Christianity, more
devoutly observed for time to come.”
The decrees of councils proving insufficient, the secular authorities were besought to issue an edict that would
strike terror to the hearts of the people, and force them
to refrain from labor on the Sunday. At a synod held in
Rome, all previous decisions were reaffirmed with greater
force and solemnity. They were also incorporated into the
ecclesiastical law, and enforced by the civil authorities
throughout nearly all Christendom.
Still the absence of scriptural authority for Sundaykeeping occasioned no little embarrassment. The people
questioned the right of their teachers to deny the positive
declaration of Jehovah, “The seventh day is the Sabbath of
the Lord thy God,” in order to honor the day of the sun. To
supply the lack of Bible testimony, Satan was ready with
expedients. A zealous advocate of Sunday, who about the
close of the twelfth century visited the churches of England,
was resisted by faithful witnesses for the truth; and so fruitless were his efforts that he departed from the country for a
season, and cast about him for some means to enforce his
teachings. When he returned, the lack was supplied, and in
his after-labors he met with greater success. He brought with
him a roll purporting to be from God Himself, and containing the needed command for Sunday observance, and awful
threats to terrify the disobedient. This precious document—
as base a counterfeit as the institution it supported—was
said to have fallen from heaven, and to have been found in
Jerusalem, upon the altar of St. Simeon, in Golgotha. The
pontifical palace at Rome was the source whence it proceeded.

342

The

Great

Controversy

Frauds and forgeries to advance the power and prosperity of
the church have in all ages been esteemed lawful by the papal hierarchy.
The roll forbade labor from the ninth hour, three o’clock,
on Saturday afternoon, till sunrise on Monday; and its authority was declared to be confirmed by many miracles. It
was reported that persons laboring beyond the appointed hour
were stricken with paralysis. A miller who attempted to grind
his corn, saw, instead of flour, a torrent of blood come forth,
and the mill-wheel stood still, notwithstanding the strong
rush of the water. A woman who placed dough in the oven,
found it raw when taken out, though the oven was very hot.
Another who had dough prepared for baking at the ninth
hour, but determined to set it aside till Monday, found the
next day that it had been made into loaves and baked by
divine power. A man who baked bread after the ninth hour
on Saturday, found, when he broke it the next morning, that
blood started therefrom. By such absurd and superstitious
fabrications did the advocates of Sunday endeavor to establish its sacredness.
In Scotland, as in England, a greater regard for Sunday was secured by uniting with it a portion of the ancient Sabbath. But the time required to be kept holy varied.
A law was passed that Saturday from twelve at noon ought
to be accounted holy, and that no man, from that time till
Monday morning, should engage in worldly business.
But notwithstanding all the efforts to establish Sunday sacredness, papists themselves publicly confessed the
divine authority of the Sabbath, and the human origin of
the institution by which it had been supplanted. In the sixteenth century a papal council plainly declared: “Let all Christians remember that the seventh day was consecrated by God,
and hath been received and observed, not only by the Jews,
but by all others who pretend to worship God; though we
Christians have changed their Sabbath into the Lord’s day.”
Those who were tampering with the divine law were not
ignorant of the character of their work. They were deliberately setting themselves above God.

Character and Aims of the Papacy

[576-578]

343

A striking illustration of Rome’s policy toward those
who honor the Sabbath was given in the long and bloody
persecution of the Waldenses. Others suffered in a similar manner for their fidelity to the same truth. Amid the
gloom of the Dark Ages, the Christians of Central Africa
were lost sight of and forgotten by the world, and for many
centuries they enjoyed freedom in the exercise of their faith.
But at last Rome learned of their existence, and the emperor
of Abyssinia was soon beguiled into an acknowledgment of
the pope as the vicar of Christ. Other concessions followed.
An edict was issued forbidding the observance of the Sabbath under the severest penalties. But papal tyranny soon
became a galling yoke; and the Abyssinians determined to
break it from their necks. After a terrible struggle, the
Romanists were banished from their dominions, and the ancient faith was restored. The churches rejoiced in their freedom, and they never forgot the lesson they had learned concerning the deception, the fanaticism, and the despotic power
of Rome. Within their solitary realm they were content to
remain, unknown to the rest of Christendom.
The churches of Africa held the Sabbath as it was held
by the papal church before her complete apostasy. While
they kept the seventh day in obedience to the commandment
of God, they abstained from labor on the Sunday in conformity to the custom of the church. Upon obtaining supreme
power, Rome had trampled upon the Sabbath of God to exalt her own; but the churches of Africa, hidden for nearly a
thousand years, did not share in this apostasy. When brought
under the sway of Rome, they were forced to set aside the
true and exalt the false Sabbath; but no sooner had they regained their independence than they returned to obedience
to the fourth commandment.
These records of the past clearly reveal the enmity of
Rome toward the true Sabbath and its defenders, and
the means which she employs to honor the institution of
her creating. The word of God teaches that these scenes are
to be repeated as papists and Protestants shall unite for the
exaltation of the Sunday. Revelation 13:11, 12. For nearly

344

The

Great

Controversy

forty years Sabbath reformers have presented this testimony
to the world. In the events now taking place is seen a rapid
advance toward the fulfillment of the prediction. There is
the same claim of divine authority for Sunday-keeping,
and the same lack of scriptural evidence, as in the days
of papal supremacy. The assertion that God’s judgments
are visited upon men for their violation of the Sunday-Sabbath, will be repeated. Already it is beginning to be urged.
Marvelous in her shrewdness and cunning is the
Romish Church. She can read what is to be. She bides
her time, seeing that the Protestant churches are paying
her homage in their acceptance of the false Sabbath, and
that they are preparing to employ the very means which she
herself employed in by-gone days. Those who reject the light
of truth will yet seek the aid of this self-styled infallible power
to exalt an institution that originated with her. How readily
she will come to the help of Protestants in this work, it is not
difficult to conjecture. Who understands better than popery how to deal with those who are disobedient to the
church?
The Christian world will learn what Romanism really is, when it is too late to escape the snare. She is silently growing into power. Her doctrines are exerting their
influence in legislative halls, in the churches, and in the hearts
of men. Throughout the land she is piling up her lofty and
massive structures, in the secret recesses of which her former
persecutions will be repeated. She is stealthily and unsuspectedly strengthening her forces to further her own ends
when the time shall come for her to strike. All that she desires is vantage ground, and this is soon to be given her.
In the near future we shall see and shall feel what the
purpose of the Roman element is. Whoever shall believe
and obey the word of God will thereby incur reproach and
persecution.
“Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge Him, and He shall direct thy paths.”

AS CHANGED TO SUND
AY
SUPPLEMENT:: HOW THE SABBA
SABBATH
WAS
SUNDA

“There is scarcely anything which strikes the mind of the careful student of
ancient ecclesiastical history with greater surprise than the comparatively early
period at which many of the corruptions of Christianity, which are embodied in
the Roman system, took their rise; yet it is not to be supposed that when the first
originators of many of these unscriptural notions and practices planted those
germs of corruption, they anticipated or even imagined they would ever grow
into such a vast and hideous system of superstition and error as is that of
popery.”—John Dowling, History of Romanism, 13th Edition, p. 65.
“It would be an error to attribute [‘the sanctification of Sunday’] to a definite
decision of the Apostles. There is no such decision mentioned the Apostolic
documents [that is, the New Testament].”—Antoine Villien, A History of the Commandments of the Church, 1915, p. 23.
“It must be confessed that there is no law in the New Testament concerning
the first day.”—McClintock and Strong, Cyclopedia of Biblical, Theological and
Ecclesiastical Literature, Vol. 9, p. 196.
“Rites and ceremonies, of which neither Paul nor Peter ever heard, crept
silently into use, and then claimed the rank of divine institutions. [Church] officers for whom the primitive disciples could have found no place, and titles which
to them would have been altogether unintelligible, began to challenge attention,
and to be named apostolic.”—William D. Killen, The Ancient Church, p. xvi.
“Until well into the second century [a hundred years after Christ] we do not
find the slightest indication in our sources that Christians marked Sunday by any
kind of abstention from work.”—W. Rordorf, Sunday, p. 157.
“The ancient Sabbath did remain and was observed . . by the Christians of
the Eastern Church [in the area near Palestine] above three hundred years after
our Saviour’s death.”—A Learned Treatise of the Sabbath, p. 77.
“Modern Christians who talk of keeping Sunday as a ‘holy’ day, as in the still
extant ‘Blue Laws,’ of colonial America, should know that as a ‘holy’ day of rest
and cessation from labor and amusements Sunday was unknown to Jesus . . It
formed no tenant [teaching] of the primitive Church and became ‘sacred’ only in
the course of time. Outside the church its observance was legalized for the Roman Empire through a series of decrees starting with the famous one of Contantine
in 321, an edict due to his political and social ideas.”—W.W. Hyde, Paganism to
Christianity in the Roman Empire, 1946, p. 257.
“The festival of Sunday, like all other festivals was always only a human
ordinance, and it was far from the intentions of the apostles to establish a Divine
command in this respect, far from them, and from the early apostolic church, to
transfer the laws of the Sabbath to Sunday.”—Augustus Neander, The History of
the Christian Religon and Church, 1843, p. 186.
“The [Catholic] Church took the pagan buckler of faith against the heathen.

Character and Aims of the Papacy

349

She took the pagan Roman Pantheon [the Roman], temple to all the gods, and
made it sacred to all the martyrs; so it stands to this day. She took the pagan
Sunday and made it the Christian Sunday . . The Sun was a foremost god with
heathendom. Balder the beautiful: the White God, the old Scandinavians called
him. The sun has worshipers at this very hour in Persia and other lands . . Hence
the Church would seem to have said, ‘Keep that old pagan name. It shall remain
consecrated, sanctified.’ And thus the pagan Sunday, dedicated to Balder, became the Christian Sunday, sacred to Jesus. The sun is a fitting emblem of
Jesus. The Fathers often compared Jesus to the sun; as they compared Mary to
the moon.”—William L. Gildea, “Paschale Gaudium,” in The Catholic World, p.
58, March 1894.
“The Church made a sacred day of Sunday . . largely because it was the
weekly festival of the sun;—for it was a definite Christian policy to take over the
pagan festivals endeared to the people by tradition, and give them a Christian
significance.”—Authur Weigall, The Paganism in Our Christianity, 1928, p. 145.
“Remains of the struggle [between the religion of Christianity and the religion
of Mithraism] are found in two institutions adopted from its rival by Christianity
in the fourth century, the two Mithraic sacred days: December 25, ‘dies natalis
solis’ [birthday of the sun], as the birthday of Jesus,—and Sunday, ‘the venerable day of the Sun,’ as Constantine called it in his edict of 321.”—Walter
Woodburn Hyde, Paganism to Christianity in the Roman Empire, p. 60.
“It is not strange that Sunday is almost universally observed when the Sacred Writings do not endorse it? Satan, the great counterfeiter, worked through
the ‘mystery of iniquity’ to introduce a counterfeit Sabbath to take the place of
the true Sabbath. Sunday stands side by side with Ash Wednesday, Palm Sunday, Holy (or Maundy) Thursday, Good Friday, Easter Sunday, Whitsunday, Corpus Christi, Assumption Day, All Soul’s Day, Christmas Day, and a host of other
ecclesiastical feast days too numorous to mention. This array of Roman Catholic feasts and fast days are all man made. None of them bears the divine credentials of the Author of the Inspired Word.”—M.E. Walsh.
“Sun worship was the earliest idolatry.”—Fausset Bible Dictionary, p. 666.
“Sun worship was “one of the oldest components of the Roman religion.”—
Gaston H. Halsberge, The Cult of Sol Invictus, 1972, p. 26.
“ ‘Babylon, the mother of harlots,’ derived much of her teaching from pagan
Rome and thence from Babylon. Sun worship—that led her to Sundaykeeping,—
was one of those choice bits of paganism that sprang originally from the heathen lore of ancient Babylon: The solar theology of the ‘Chaldeans’ had a decisive effect upon the final development of Semitic paganism . . [It led to their]
seeing the sun the directing power of the cosmic system. All the Baals were
thence forward turned into suns; the sun itself being the mover of the other
stars—like it eternal and ‘unconquerable’ . . Such was the final form reached by

the religion of the pagan Semites, and following them, by that of the Romans . .
when they raised ‘Sol Invictus’ [the Invincible Sun] to the rank of supreme divinity in the empire.”—Franz F.V.M. Cummont, Astrology and Religion among the
Greeks and Romans, p. 55.
“When Christianity conquered Rome, the ecclesiastical structure of the pagan church, the title and the vestments of the ‘pontifex maximus,’ the worship ot
the ‘Great Mother’ goddess and a multitude of comforting divinities, . . the joy or
solemnity of old festivals, and the pageantry of immemorial ceremony, passed
like material blood into the new religion,—and captive Rome conquered her conqueror. The reins and skills of government were handed down by a dying empire
to a virile papacy.”—Will Durant, Caesar and Christ, p. 672.
“The power of the Ceasars lived again in the universal dominion of the
popes.”—H.G. Guiness, Romanism and the Reformation.
“Like two sacred rivers flowing from paradise, the Bible and divine Tradition
contain the Word of God, the precious gems of revealed truth. Though these two
divine streams are in themselves, on account of their divine origin, of equal
sacredness, and are both full of revealed truths, still, of the two, Tradition [the
sayings of popes and councils] is to us more clear and safe.”—Di Bruno, Catholic
Belief, p. 33.
“Unquestionably the first law, either ecclesiastical or civil, by which the Sabbatical observance of that day is known to have been ordained, is the edict of
Constantine, A.D. 321.”—Chamber’s Encyclopedia, article, “Sabbath.”
Here is the first Sunday law in history, a legal enactment by Constantine I
(reigned 306-337): “On the Venerable Day of the Sun [“Venerable die Solis”—
the sacred day of the Sun] let the magistrates and people residing in cities rest,
and let all workshops be closed. In the country, however, persons engaged in
agriculture may freely and lawfully continue their pursuits; because it often happens that another day is not so suitable for grain-sowing or for vine-planting;
lest by neglecting the proper moment for such operations the bounty of heaven
should by lost—given the 7th day of March [A.D. 321], Crispus and Constanstine
being consuls each of them for the second time.”—The First Sunday Law of
Constantine I, in “Codex Justianianus,” lib. 3, tit. 12,3; trans. in Phillip Schaff,
History of the Christian Church, Vol. 3, p. 380.
“This [Constantine’s Sunday decree of March 321] is the ‘parent’ Sunday
law making it a day of rest and release from labor. For from that time to the
present there have been decrees about the observance of Sunday which have
profoundly influenced European and American society. When the Church became a part of State under the Christian emperors, Sunday observance was
enforced by civil statutes, and later when the Empire was past, the Church in the
hands of the papacy enforced it by ecclesiastical and also by civil enactments.”—
Walter W. Hyde, Paganism to Christianity in the Roman Empire, 1946, p. 261.

Character and Aims of the Papacy

351

“Constantine’s decree marked the beginning of a long, though intermittent
series of imperial decrees in support of Sunday rest.”—Vincent J. Kelly, Forbidden Sunday and Feast-Day Occupations, 1943, p. 29.
“Constantine labored at this time untiringly to unite the worshipers of the old
and the new into one religion. All his laws and contrivances aimed at promoting
this amalgamation of means melt together a purified heathenism and a moderated Christianity . . Of all his blending and melting together of Christianity and
heathenism, none is more easy to see through than this making of his Sunday
law: The Christians worshiped their Christ, the heathen their sun-god [so they
should now be combined].”—H.G. Heggtveit, Illustreret Kirkehistorie, 1895, p.
202.
“If every Sunday is to be observed by Christians on account of the resurrection, then every Sabbath on account of the burial is to be regarded in execration
[cursing] of the Jews.”—Pope Sylvester, quoted by S.R.E. Humbert, “Adversus
Graecorum Calumnias,” in J.P. Migne, Patrologie, p. 143 [Sylvester (A.D. 314337) was the pope at the time Constantine I was Emperor].
“All things whatsoever that were prescribed for the [Bible] Sabbath, we have
transferred them to the Lord’s day, as being more authoratative and more highly
regarded and first in rank, and more honorble than the Jewish Sabbath.”—Bishop
Eusebius, quoted in J.P. Migne, “Patrologie,” p. 23, 1169-1172 [Eusebius of
Caesarea was a high-ranking Catholic leader during Constantine’s lifetime].
“As we have already noted, excepting for the Roman and Alexandrian Christians, the majority of Christians were observing the seventh-day Sabbath at least
as late as the middle of the fifth century [A.D. 450]. The Roman and Alexandrian
Christians were among those converted from heathenism. They began observing Sunday as a merry religious festival in honor of the Lord’s resurrection,
about the latter half of the second century A.D. However, they did not try to teach
that the Lord or His apostles commanded it. In fact, no ecclesiastical writer
before Eusebius of Caesarea in the fourth century even suggested that either
Christ or His apostles instituted the observance of the first day of the week.
“These Gentile Christians of Rome and Alexandria began calling the first day
of the week ‘the Lord’s day.’ This was not difficult for the pagans of the Roman
Empire who were steeped in sun worship to accept, because they [the pagans]
referred to their sun-god as their ‘Lord.’ ”—E.M. Chalmers, How Sunday Came
into the Christian Church, p. 3.
The following statement was made 100 years after Constantine’s Sunday
Law was passed: “Although almost all churches throughout the world celebrate
the sacred mysteries on the Sabbath every week, yet the Christians of Alexandria
and at Rome, on account of some ancient tradition, have ceased to do this.”—
Socraties Scholasticus, quoted in Ecclesiastical History, Book 5, chap. 22 [written shortly after A.D. 439].

352

The

Great

Controversy

“The people of Constantinople, and almost everywhere, assemble together on
the Sabbath, as well as on the first day of the week, which custom is never observed
at Rome or at Alexandria.”—Hermias Sozomen, quoted in Ecclesiastical History,
vii, 19, in A Select Library of Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers, 2nd Series, Vol. 2, p.
390 [written soon after A.D. 415].
“Down even to the fifth century the observance of the Jewish Sabbath was
continued in the Christian church, but with a rigor and solemnity gradually diminishing until it was wholly discontinued.”—Lyman Coleman, Ancient Christianity Exemplified, chap. 26, sec. 2, p. 527.
“Contantine’s [five Sunday Law] decrees marked the beginning of a long though
intermittent series of imperial decrees in support of Sunday rest.”—A History of the
Councils of the Church, Vol. 2, p. 316.
“What began, however, as a pagan ordinance, ended as a Christian regulation;
and a long series of imperial decrees, during the fourth, fifth, and sixth, centuries,
enjoined with increasing stringency abstinence from labor on Sunday.”—Hutton
Webster, Rest Days, pp. 122-123, 270.
Here is the first Sunday Law decree of a Christian council. It was given about 16
years after Constantine’s first Sunday Law of A.D. 321: “Christians shall not Judaize
and be idle on Saturday [in the original: ‘sabbato’—shall not be idle on the Sabbath],
but shall work on that day; but the Lord’s day they shall especially honour, and as
being Christians, shall, if possible, do no work on that day. If, however, they are
found Judaizing, they shall by shut out [‘anathema,’—excommunicated] from
Christ.”—Council of Laodicea, c. A.D. 337, Canon 29, quoted in C.J. Hefele, A
History of the Councils of the Church, Vol. 2, p. 316.
“The keeping of the Sunday rest arose from the custom of the people and the
constitution of the [Catholic] Church . . Tertullian was probably the first to refer to a
cessation of affairs on the Sun day; the Council of Laodicea issued the first counciliar
legislation for that day; Constantine I issued the first civil legislation.”—Priest Vincent
J. Kelly, Forbidden Sunday and Feast-Day Occupations, p. 203 [a thesis presented
to the Catholic University of America].
“About 590, Pope Gregory, in a letter to the Roman people, denounced as the
prophets of Antichrist those who maintained that work ought not to be done on the
seventh day.”—James T. Ringgold, The Law of Sunday, p. 267.
In the centuries that followed, persecution against believers in the Bible Sabbath
intensified until very few were left alive. When the Reformation began, the true Sabbath was almost unknown.
“Now the [Catholic] Church . . instituted, by God’s authority, Sunday as the day
of worship. The same Church, by the same divine authority, taught the doctrine of
Purgatory . . We have, therefore, the same authority for Purgatory as we have for
Sunday.”—Martin J. Scott, Things Catholics Are Asked about, 1927, p. 236.
“Of course the Catholic Church claims that the change [of the Sabbath to Sunday] was her act . . AND THE ACT IS A MARK of her ecclesiastical power.”—From
the office of Cardinal Gibbons, through Chancellor H.F. Thomas, Nov 11, 1895.

Chapter Thirty One

Satan’s
Master Plan

— The Coming Conflict

———————————————————————

God never forces the will or the conscience, but in both, Satan
delights. And in the near future a renewal of such coercion will to
be seen. Errors that strike insolently against the authority of Heaven
will soon be brought boldly to the front—and given legal backing —
Will you and I be ready for the final conflict described in
Revelation? Here you will learn for yourself the issues of Satan’s
Master Plan —

———————————————————————

The greatest and most favored nation upon the earth
is the United States. A gracious Providence has shielded
this country, and poured upon her the choicest of
Heaven’s blessings. Here the persecuted and oppressed
have found refuge. Here the Christian faith in its purity has
been taught. This people have been the recipients of great
light and unrivaled mercies. But these gifts have been repaid
by ingratitude and forgetfulness of God. The Infinite One
keeps a reckoning with the nations, and their guilt is proportioned to the light rejected. A fearful record now stands
in the register of Heaven against our land; but the crime which
shall fill up the measure of her iniquity is that of making
void the law of God.
Between the laws of men and the precepts of Jehovah
will come the last great conflict of the controversy between truth and error. Upon this battle we are now entering,—a battle not between rival churches contending
for the supremacy, but between the religion of the Bible
and the religion of fable and tradition. The agencies which
will unite against truth and righteousness in this contest are

354

The

Great

Controversy

now actively at work.
God’s holy word, which has been handed down to us
at such a cost of suffering and blood, is but little valued.
The Bible is within the reach of all, but there are few
who really accept it as the guide of life. Infidelity prevails
to an alarming extent, not in the world merely, but in the
church. Many have come to deny doctrines which are the
very pillars of the Christian faith. The great facts of creation
as presented by the inspired writers, the fall of man, the atonement, and the perpetuity of the law of God, are practically
rejected by a large share of the professedly Christian world.
Thousands who pride themselves upon their wisdom and independence regard it an evidence of weakness to place implicit confidence in the Bible, and a proof of superior talent
and learning to cavil at the Scriptures, and to spiritualize
and explain away their most important truths. Many ministers are teaching their people, and many professors and teachers are instructing their students, that the law of God has
been changed or abrogated; and they ridicule those who are
so simple-minded as to acknowledge all its claims.
In rejecting the truth, men reject its Author. In trampling upon the law of God, they deny the authority of the
Lawgiver. It is as easy to make an idol of false doctrines
and theories as to fashion an idol of wood or stone. Satan
leads men to conceive of God in a false character, as having
attributes which He does not possess. A philosophical idol
is enthroned in the place of Jehovah; while the true God,
as He is revealed in His word, in Christ, and in the works
of creation, is worshiped by but few. Thousands deify
nature, while they deny the God of nature. Though in a
different form, idolatry exists in the Christian world today as verily as it existed among ancient Israel in the
days of Elijah. The god of many professedly wise men, of
philosophers, poets, politicians, journalists,—the god of
polished fashionable circles, of many colleges and universities, even of some theological institutions,—is little better
than Baal, the sun-god of Phenicia.
No error accepted by the Christian world strikes more

The

Coming

Conflict

[582-585]

355

boldly against the authority of Heaven, none is more directly opposed to the dictates of reason, none is more
pernicious in its results, than the modern doctrine, so
rapidly gaining ground, that God’s law is no longer
obligatory upon men. Every nation has its laws, which command respect and obedience; and has the Creator of the heavens and the earth no law to govern the beings He has made?
Suppose that prominent ministers were publicly to teach that
the statutes which govern our nation and protect the rights
of its citizens were not obligatory,—that they restricted the
liberties of the people, and therefore ought not to be obeyed;
how long would such men be tolerated in the pulpit? But is it
a graver offense to disregard the laws of States and nations
than to trample upon those divine precepts which are the
foundation of all government? When the standard of righteousness is set aside, the way is open for the prince of
evil to establish his rule in the earth.
It would be far more consistent for nations to abolish
their statutes, and permit the people to do as they please,
than for the Ruler of the universe to annul His law, and
leave the world without a standard to condemn the guilty or
justify the obedient. Would we know the result of making
void the law of God? The experiment has been tried. Terrible were the scenes enacted in France when atheism became the controlling power. It was then demonstrated to the
world that to throw off the restraints which God has imposed
is to accept the rule of the cruelest of tyrants.
Wherever the divine precepts are set aside, sin ceases
to appear sinful, or righteousness desirable. Those who
refuse to submit to the government of God are wholly
unfitted to govern themselves. Through their pernicious
teachings, the spirit of insubordination is implanted in the
hearts of children and youth, who are naturally impatient of
control; and a lawless, licentious state of society results.
While scoffing at the credulity of those who obey the requirements of God, the multitudes eagerly accept the delusions of Satan. They give the rein to lust, and practice the
sins which called down judgments upon the heathen.

356

The

Great

Controversy

Let the restraint imposed by the divine law be wholly
removed, and human laws would soon be disregarded.
Because God forbids dishonest practices, coveting, lying,
and defrauding, men are ready to trample upon His statutes
as a hindrance to their worldly prosperity; but the results of
banishing these precepts would be such as they do not anticipate. If the law were not binding, why should any fear to
transgress? Property would no longer be safe. Men would
obtain their neighbor’s possessions by violence; and the
strongest would become richest. Life itself would not be respected. Those who disregard the commandments of God
sow disobedience to reap disobedience. The marriage vow
would no longer stand as a sacred bulwark to protect the
family. He who had the power, would, if he desired, take his
neighbor’s wife by violence. The fifth commandment would
be set aside with the fourth. Children would not shrink from
taking the life of their parents, if by so doing they could obtain the desire of their corrupt hearts. The civilized world
would become a horde of robbers and assassins; and peace,
rest, and happiness would be banished from the earth.
Already the doctrine that men are released from obedience to God’s requirements has weakened the force of
moral obligation, and opened the flood-gates of iniquity
upon the world. Lawlessness, dissipation, and corruption
are sweeping in upon us like an overwhelming tide. In the
family, Satan is at work. His banner waves, even in professedly Christian households. There is envy, evil surmising, hypocrisy, estrangement, emulation, strife, betrayal of
sacred trusts, indulgence of lust. The whole system of religious principles and doctrines, which should form the foundation and frame-work of social life, seems to be a tottering
mass, ready to fall to ruin. The vilest of criminals, when
thrown into prison for their offenses, are often made the recipients of gifts and attentions, as if they had attained an
enviable distinction. The greatest publicity is given to their
character and crimes. The press publish the revolting details
of vice, thus initiating others into the practice of fraud, robbery, and murder; and Satan exults in the success of his hell-

The

[585-587]

ish schemes. The infatuation of vice, the wanton taking of
life, the terrible increase of intemperance and iniquity of every order and degree, should arouse all who fear God, to
inquire what can be done to stay the tide of evil.
Courts of justice are corrupt. Rulers are actuated by
desire for gain, and love of sensual pleasure. Intemperance has beclouded the faculties of many, so that Satan
has almost complete control of them. Jurists are perverted,
bribed, deluded. Drunkenness and revelry, passion, envy, dishonesty of every sort, are represented among those who administer the laws. “Justice standeth afar off; for truth is fallen
in the street, and equity cannot enter.”
The iniquity and spiritual darkness that prevailed
under the supremacy of Rome were the inevitable result
of her suppression of the Scriptures; but where is to be
found the cause of the wide-spread infidelity, the rejection of
the law of God, and the consequent corruption, under the
full blaze of gospel light in an age of religious freedom?
Now that Satan can no longer keep the world under his
control by withholding the Scriptures, he resorts to other
means to accomplish the same object. To destroy faith in
the Bible serves his purpose as well as to destroy the
Bible itself. By introducing the belief that God’s law is
not binding, he as effectually leads men to transgress as
if they were wholly ignorant of its precepts. And now, as
in former ages, he has worked through the church to further
his designs. As the religious organizations of the day have
refused to listen to unpopular truths plainly brought to view
in the Scriptures, they have sown broadcast the seeds of skepticism. Clinging to the papal error of natural immortality and
man’s consciousness in death, they reject the only defense
against the delusions of Spiritualism. Nor is this all. As the
claims of the fourth commandment are urged upon the people,
popular teachers find that the observance of the seventh-day
Sabbath is there enjoined; and as the only way to free themselves from a duty which they are unwilling to perform, they
declare that the law of God is no longer binding. Thus they
cast away the law and the Sabbath together. As the work

358

The

Great

Controversy

of Sabbath reform extends, this rejection of the divine
law to avoid the claims of the fourth commandment will
become well-nigh universal. Upon those religious leaders
whose teachings have opened the door to infidelity, to Spiritualism, and to contempt for God’s holy law, rests a fearful
responsibility for the iniquity that exists in the Christian
world.
Yet this very class put forth the claim that the fastspreading corruption is largely attributable to the desecration of the so-called “Christian Sabbath,” and that
the enforcement of Sunday observance would greatly improve the morals of society. Combining the temperance reform with the Sunday movement, they represent themselves
as laboring to promote the highest interests of society; and
those who refuse to unite with them are denounced as the
enemies of temperance and reform. But the fact that a movement to establish error is connected with a work which is in
itself good, is not an argument in favor of the error. We may
disguise poison by mingling it with wholesome food, but we
do not thereby change its nature. On the contrary, it is rendered more dangerous, as it is more likely to be taken unawares. It is one of Satan’s devices to combine with falsehood just enough truth to give it plausibility. The leaders of the Sunday movement may advocate reforms which
the people need, principles which are in harmony with
the Bible, yet while there is with these a requirement
which is contrary to God’s law, His servants cannot unite
with them. Nothing can justify them in setting aside the commandments of God for the precepts of men.
Through the two great errors, the immortality of the
soul and Sunday sacredness, Satan will bring the people
under his deceptions. While the former lays the foundation of Spiritualism, the latter creates a bond of sympathy with Rome. Protestantism will yet stretch her hand
across the gulf to grasp the hand of Spiritualism; she
will reach over the abyss to clasp hands with the Roman
power; and under the influence of this threefold union,
our country will follow in the steps of Rome in trampling

[587-589]

on the rights of conscience.
Spiritualism is now changing its form, veiling some of
its more objectionable and immoral features, and assuming a Christian guise. Formerly it denounced Christ and
the Bible; now it professes to accept both. The Bible is interpreted in a manner that is attractive to the unrenewed heart,
while its solemn and vital truths are made of no effect. A
God of love is presented; but His justice, His denunciations
of sin, the requirements of His holy law, are all kept out of
sight. Pleasing, bewitching fables captivate the senses of
those who do not make God’s word the foundation of their
faith. Christ is as verily rejected as before; but Satan has so
blinded the eyes of the people that the deception is not discerned.
As Spiritualism assimilates more closely to the nominal Christianity of the day, it has greater power to deceive and ensnare. Satan himself is converted, after the
modern order of things. He will appear in the character of an
angel of light. Through the agency of Spiritualism, miracles
will be wrought, the sick will be healed, and many undeniable wonders will be performed. And as the spirits will profess faith in the Bible, and express regard for Sunday, their
work will be accepted as a manifestation of divine power.
The line of distinction between professing Christians
and the ungodly is now hardly distinguishable. Churchmembers love what the world loves, and are ready to join
with them; and Satan determines to unite them in one body
and thus strengthen his cause by sweeping all into the ranks
of Spiritualism. Papists who boast of miracles as a certain
mark of the true church, will be readily deceived by this wonder-working power; and Protestants, having cast away the
shield of truth, will also be deluded. Papists, Protestants,
and worldlings will alike accept the form of godliness without the power, and they will see in this union a grand movement for the conversion of the world, and the ushering in of
the long-expected millennium.
Through Spiritualism, Satan appears as a benefactor
of the race, healing the diseases of the people, and pro-

360

Controversy

fessing to present a new and more exalted system of religious faith; but at the same time he works as a destroyer.
His temptations are leading multitudes to ruin. Intemperance
dethrones reason; sensual indulgence, strife, and bloodshed
follow. Satan delights in war; for it excites the worst passions of the soul, and then sweeps into eternity its victims
steeped in vice and blood. It is his object to incite the nations
to war against one another; for he can thus divert the minds
of the people from the work of preparation to stand in the
day of God.
Satan works through the elements also to garner his
harvest of unprepared souls. He has studied the secrets
of the laboratories of nature, and he uses all his power to
control the elements as far as God allows. When he was
suffered to afflict Job, how quickly flocks and herds, servants, houses, children, were swept away, one trouble succeeding another as in a moment. It is God that shields His
creatures, and hedges them in from the power of the destroyer.
But the Christian world has shown contempt for the law of
Jehovah; and the Lord does just what He has declared that
He would do, He withdraws His blessings from the earth,
and removes His protecting care from those who are rebelling against His law, and teaching and forcing others to do
the same. Satan has control of all whom God does not especially guard. He will favor and prosper some in order to further his own designs, and he will bring trouble upon others,
and lead men to believe that it is God who is afflicting them.
While appearing to the children of men as a great physician who can heal all their maladies, He will bring disease and disaster until populous cities are reduced to ruin
and desolation. Even now he is at work. In accidents and
calamities by sea and by land, in great conflagrations, in fierce
tornadoes and terrific hailstorms, in tempests, floods, cyclones, tidal waves, and earthquakes, in every place and in a
thousand forms, is Satan exercising his power. He sweeps
away the ripening harvest, and famine and distress follow.
He imparts to the air a deadly taint, and thousands perish by
the pestilence. These visitations are to become more and more

The

Coming

Conflict

[589-592]

361

frequent and disastrous. Destruction will be upon the inhabitants of the world. The beasts of the field will groan, and
the earth will languish.
And then the great deceiver will persuade men that
those who serve God are causing these evils. The class
that have provoked the displeasure of Heaven will charge all
their troubles upon the faithful few whom the Lord has sent
to them with messages of warning and reproof. It will be
declared that the nation is offending God by the violation of the Sunday-Sabbath, that this sin has brought calamities which will not cease until Sunday observance shall
be strictly enforced, and that those who present the claims of
the fourth commandment, thus destroying reverence for Sunday, are troublers of the nation, preventing its restoration to
divine favor and temporal prosperity. Thus the accusation
urged of old against the servant of God will be repeated, and
upon grounds equally well established. “And it came to pass
when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said unto him, Art thou he
that troubleth Israel? And he answered, I have not troubled
Israel, but thou and thy father’s house, in that ye have forsaken the commandments of the Lord, and thou hast followed Baalim.” 1 Kings 18:17, 18. As the wrath of the people
shall be excited by false charges, they will pursue a course
toward God’s ambassadors very similar to that which apostate Israel pursued toward Elijah.
The miracle-working power manifested through Spiritualism will exert its influence against those who choose
to obey God rather than men. Messages will come from
the spirits declaring that God has sent them to inform the
rejecters of Sunday that they are in error, and that the laws of
the land should be obeyed as the law of God. They will lament the great wickedness in the world, and second the testimony of religious teachers, that the degraded state of morals
is caused by the desecration of Sunday. Great will be the
indignation excited against all who refuse to accept their testimony.
Those who honor the Bible Sabbath will be denounced
as enemies of law and order, as breaking down the moral

362

The

Great

Controversy

restraints of society, causing anarchy and corruption, and
calling down the judgments of God upon the earth. Their
conscientious scruples will be pronounced obstinacy, stubbornness, and contempt of authority. They will be accused
of disaffection toward the government. Ministers who deny
the obligation of the divine law will present from the pulpit
the duty of yielding obedience to the civil authorities as ordained of God. In legislative halls and courts of justice, commandment-keepers will be censured and misrepresented. A
false coloring will be given to their words; the worst possible construction will be put upon their motives.
The Protestant churches have rejected the clear, scriptural arguments in defense of God’s law, and they long
to stop the mouths of those whose faith they cannot overthrow by the Bible. Though they blind their own eyes to the
fact, they are now adopting a course which will lead to the
persecution of those who conscientiously refuse to do what
the rest of the Christian world are doing, and acknowledge
the claims of the papal Sabbath.
The dignitaries of Church and State will unite to bribe,
persuade, or compel all classes to honor the Sunday. The
lack of divine authority will be supplied by oppressive
enactments. Political corruption is destroying love of justice and regard for truth, and in order to secure public favor,
legislators will yield to the popular demand for a law enforcing Sunday observance. Liberty of conscience, which has
cost this nation so great a sacrifice, will no longer be respected. In the soon-coming conflict we shall see exemplified the prophet’s words: “And the dragon was wroth with
the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her
seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the
testimony of Jesus Christ.” Revelation 12:17.
Our land is in jeopardy. The time is drawing on when
its legislators shall so abjure the principles of Protestantism as to give countenance to Romish apostasy. The
people for whom God has so marvelously wrought, strengthening them to throw off the galling yoke of popery, will by a
national act give vigor to the corrupt faith of Rome, and thus

The Coming Conflict

[592]

363

arouse the tyranny which only waits for a touch to start again
into cruelty and despotism. With rapid steps are we already approaching this period. When Protestant
churches shall seek the support of the secular power, thus
following the example of that apostate church, for opposing which their ancestors endured the fiercest persecution, then will there be a national apostasy which will
end only in national ruin.

To the law and to the testimony. If they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in
them.” Isaiah 8:20. The people of God are directed to
the Scriptures as their safeguard against the influence of
false teachers and the delusive power of spirits of darkness. Satan employs every possible device to prevent men
from obtaining a knowledge of the Bible; for its plain utterances reveal his deceptions. At every revival of God’s work,
the prince of evil is aroused to more intense activity; he is
now putting forth his utmost efforts for a final, despairing
struggle against Christ and His followers. The last great
delusion is soon to open before us. Antichrist is to perform his marvelous works in our sight. So closely will
the counterfeit resemble the true, that it will be impossible to distinguish between them except by the Holy
Scriptures. By their testimony every statement and every miracle must be tested.
Those who endeavor to obey all the commandments
of God will be opposed and derided; their way will be

made very hard. They can stand only in God. In order to
endure the trial before them, they must understand the will
of God as revealed in His word; they can honor Him only as
they have a right conception of His character, government,
and purposes, and act in accordance with them. None but
those who have trained the intellect to grasp the truths of the
Bible will stand through the last great conflict. To every
soul will come the searching test, Shall I obey God rather
than men? The decisive hour is even now at hand. Are our
feet planted on the rock of God’s immutable word? Are we
prepared to stand firm in defense of the commandments of
God and the faith of Jesus?
Before His crucifixion the Saviour explained to His disciples that He was to be put to death, and to rise again from
the tomb; and angels were present to impress His words on
minds and hearts. But the disciples were looking for temporal deliverance from the Roman yoke, and they could not
tolerate the thought that He in whom all their hopes centered
should suffer an ignominious death. The words which they
needed to remember were banished from their minds; and
when the time of trial came, it found them unprepared. The
death of Jesus as fully destroyed their hopes as if He had not
forewarned them. So in the prophecies the future is opened
before us as plainly as it was opened to the disciples by the
words of Christ. The events connected with the close of
probation and the work of preparation for the time of
trouble, are clearly brought to view. But multitudes have
no more understanding of these important truths than if
they had never been revealed. Satan watches to catch away
every impression that would make them wise unto salvation,
and the time of trouble will find them unready.
When God sends to men warnings so important that
they are represented as proclaimed by holy angels flying
in the midst of heaven, He requires every person endowed
with reasoning powers to heed the message. The fearful
judgments denounced against the worship of the beast
and his image (Revelation 14:9-12), should lead all to a
diligent study of the prophecies to learn what the mark

366

The

Great

Controversy

of the beast is, and how they are to avoid receiving it.
But the masses of the people turn away their ears from hearing the truth, and are turned unto fables. The apostle Paul
declared, looking down to the last days, “The time will come
when they will not endure sound doctrine.” 2 Timothy 4:3.
That time has fully come. The multitudes do not want Bible
truth, because it interferes with the desires of the sinful,
world-loving heart; and Satan supplies the deceptions which
they love.
But God will have a people upon the earth to maintain the Bible, and the Bible only, as the standard of all
doctrines and the basis of all reforms. The opinions of
learned men, the deductions of science, the creeds or decisions of ecclesiastical councils, as numerous and discordant
as are the churches which they represent, the voice of the
majority,—not one or all of these should be regarded as evidence for or against any point of religious faith. Before accepting any doctrine or precept, we should demand a
plain “Thus saith the Lord” in its support.
Satan is constantly endeavoring to attract attention
to man in the place of God. He leads the people to look to
bishops, to pastors, to professors of theology, as their guides,
instead of searching the Scriptures to learn their duty for
themselves. Then by controlling the minds of these leaders
he can influence the multitudes according to his will.
When Christ came to speak the words of life, the common people heard him gladly; and many, even of the priests
and rulers, believed on Him. But the chief of the priesthood
and the leading men of the nation were determined to condemn and repudiate His teachings. Though they were baffled
in all their efforts to find accusations against Him, though
they could not but feel the influence of the divine power and
wisdom attending His words, yet they encased themselves in
prejudice; they rejected the clearest evidence of His
Messiahship, lest they should be forced to become His disciples. These opponents of Jesus were men whom the
people had been taught from infancy to reverence, to
whose authority they had been accustomed implicitly to

The

Scriptures,

a

Safeguard

[595-597]

367

bow. “How is it,” they asked, “that our rulers and learned
scribes do not believe on Jesus? Would not these pious men
receive Him if He were the Christ?” It was the influence of
such teachers that led the Jewish nation to reject their
Redeemer.
The spirit which actuated those priests and rulers is still
manifested by many who make a high profession of piety.
They refuse to examine the testimony of the Scriptures concerning the special truths for this time. They point to their
own numbers, wealth, and popularity, and look with contempt upon the advocates of truth as few, poor, and unpopular, having a faith that separates them from the world.
Christ foresaw that the undue assumption of authority practiced by the scribes and Pharisees would not cease
with the dispersion of the Jews. He had a prophetic view
of the work of exalting human authority to rule the conscience, which has been so terrible a curse to the church
in all ages. And his fearful denunciations of the scribes and
Pharisees, and his warnings to the people not to follow these
blind leaders, were placed on record as an admonition to future generations.
With the many warnings against false teachers, why
are the people so ready to commit the keeping of their
souls to the clergy? There are to-day thousands of professors of religion who can give no other reason for points
of faith which they hold than that they were so instructed
by their religious leaders. They pass by the Saviour’s teachings almost unnoticed, and place implicit confidence in the
words of the ministers. But are ministers infallible? How
can we trust our souls to their guidance unless we know from
God’s word that they are light-bearers? A lack of moral courage to step aside from the beaten track of the world, leads
many to follow in the steps of learned men; and by their
reluctance to investigate for themselves, they are becoming
hopelessly fastened in the chains of error. They see that the
truth for this time is plainly brought to view in the Bible,
and they feel the power of the Holy Spirit attending its
proclamation; yet they allow the opposition of the clergy

368

The

Great

Controversy

to turn them from the light. Though reason and conscience
are convinced, these deluded souls dare not think differently
from the minister; and their individual judgment, their eternal interests, are sacrificed to the unbelief, the pride and prejudice, of another.
Many are the forms of human influence through which
Satan works to bind his captives. He secures multitudes
to himself by attaching them by the silken cords of affection to those who are enemies of the cross of Christ.
Whatever this attachment may be, parental, filial, conjugal,
or social, the effect is the same; the opposers of truth rule
with despotic power, and the souls held under their sway
have not sufficient courage or independence to obey their
own convictions of duty.
The truth and the glory of God are inseparable; it is
impossible for us, with the Bible within our reach, to
honor God by erroneous opinions. It is the first and highest duty of every rational being to learn from the Scriptures what is truth, and then to walk in the light, and
encourage others to follow his example. Ignorance of God’s
word is sin, when every provision has been made that we
may become wise. We should day by day study the Bible
diligently, weighing every thought, and comparing scripture
with scripture. With divine help, we are to form our opinions for ourselves, as we are to answer for ourselves before God.
The truths most plainly revealed in the Bible have been
involved in doubt and darkness by learned men, who,
with a pretense of great wisdom, teach that the Scriptures
have a mystical, a secret, spiritual meaning not apparent in
the language employed. These men are false teachers. It was
to such a class that Jesus declared, “Ye know not the Scriptures, neither the power of God.” Mark 12:24. The language
of the Bible should be explained according to its obvious
meaning unless a symbol or figure is employed. Christ has
given the promise, “If any man will do His will, he shall
know of the doctrine.” John 7:17. If men would but take
the Bible as it reads, if there were no false teachers to

The

Scriptures,

a

Safeguard

[597-600]

369

mislead and confuse their minds, a work would be accomplished that would make angels glad, and that would
bring into the fold of Christ thousands upon thousands
who are now wandering in error.
We should exert all the powers of the mind in the study
of the Scriptures, and should task the understanding to comprehend, as far as mortals can, the deep things of God; yet
we must not forget that the docility and submission of a child
is the true spirit of the learner. Scriptural difficulties can never
be mastered by the same methods that are employed in grappling with philosophical problems. We should not engage in
the study of the Bible with that self-reliance with which so
many enter the domains of science, but with a prayerful dependence upon God, and a sincere desire to learn His will.
We must come with a humble and teachable spirit to obtain
knowledge from the great I AM. Otherwise, evil angels will
so blind our minds and harden our hearts that we shall not be
impressed by the truth.
Many a portion of Scripture which learned men pronounce a mystery, or pass over as unimportant, is full of
comfort and instruction to him who has been taught in the
school of Christ. One reason why many theologians have no
clearer understanding of God’s word is, they close their eyes
to truths which they do not wish to practice. An understanding of Bible truth depends not so much on the power of
intellect brought to the search as on the singleness of
purpose, the earnest longing after righteousness.
Never should the Bible be studied without prayer. The
Holy Spirit alone can cause us to feel the importance of those
things easy to be understood, or prevent us from wresting
truths difficult of comprehension. It is the office of heavenly
angels to prepare the heart to so comprehend God’s word
that we shall be charmed with its beauty, admonished by its
warnings, or animated and strengthened by its promises. We
should make the psalmist’s petition our own: “Open thou
mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of Thy
law.” Psalm 119:18. Temptations often appear irresistible
because through neglect of prayer and the study of the Bible

370

The

Great

Controversy

the tempted one cannot readily remember God’s promises
and meet Satan with the Scripture weapons. But angels are
round about those who are willing to be taught in divine
things, and in the time of great necessity, they will bring
to their remembrance the very truths which are needed.
Thus when the enemy comes in like a flood, the Spirit of the
Lord will lift up a standard against him.
All who value their eternal interests should be on their
guard against the inroads of skepticism. The very pillars
of truth will be assailed. It is impossible to keep beyond the
reach of the sarcasms and sophisms, the insidious and pestilent teachings, of modern infidelity. Satan adapts his temptations to all classes. He assails the illiterate with a jest or
sneer, while he meets the educated with scientific objections
and philosophical reasoning, alike calculated to excite distrust or contempt of the Scriptures. Even youth of little experience presume to insinuate doubts concerning the fundamental principles of Christianity. And this youthful infidelity, shallow as it is, has its influence. Many are thus led to
jest at the faith of their fathers, and to do despite to the Spirit
of grace. Many a life that promised to be an honor to God
and a blessing to the world, has been blighted by the foul
breath of infidelity. All who trust to the boastful decisions of
human reason, and imagine that they can explain divine mysteries, and arrive at truth unaided by the wisdom of God, are
entangled in the snare of Satan.
We are living in the most solemn period of this world’s
history. The destiny of earth’s teeming multitudes is about
to be decided. Our own future well-being and also the
salvation of other souls depends upon the course which
we now pursue. We need to be guided by the Spirit of truth.
Every follower of Christ should earnestly inquire, “Lord, what
wilt thou have me to do?” We need to humble ourselves before the Lord, with fasting and prayer, and to meditate much
upon His word, especially upon the scenes of the Judgment.
We should now seek a deep and living experience in the
things of God. We have not a moment to lose. Events of
vital importance are transpiring around us; we are on

The

[600-602]

371

Satan’s enchanted ground. Sleep not, sentinels of God; the
foe is lurking near, ready at any moment, should you become
lax and drowsy, to spring upon you and make you his prey.
Many are deceived as to their true condition before
God. They congratulate themselves upon the wrong acts
which they do not commit, and forget to enumerate the good
and noble deeds which God requires of them, but which they
have neglected to perform. It is not enough that they are trees
in the garden of God. They are to answer His expectation by
bearing fruit. He holds them accountable for their failure to
accomplish all the good which they could have done, through
His grace strengthening them. In the books of Heaven they
are registered as cumberers of the ground.
When the testing time shall come, those who have
made God’s word their rule of life will be revealed. In
summer there is no noticeable difference between evergreens
and other trees; but when the blasts of winter come, the evergreens remain unchanged, while other trees are stripped of
their foliage. So the false-hearted professor may not now be
distinguished from the real Christian, but the time is just
upon us when the difference will be apparent. Let opposition arise, let the voice of the dragon be heard, let persecution be kindled, and the half-hearted and hypocritical
will waver and yield the faith; but the true Christian will
stand firm as a rock, his faith stronger, his hope brighter,
than in days of prosperity.
“Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the
ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the
seat of the scornful. But his delight is in the law of the Lord;
and in His law doth he meditate day and night. And he shall
be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth
forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not wither;
and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.” Psalm 1:1-3.

the most massive crises of the ages is just before mankind. Of

glory. And he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying,

cage of every unclean and hateful bird.” “And I heard another voice from Heaven, saying, Come out of her, My
people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.” Revelation 18:1, 2, 4.
In this scripture the announcement of the fall of Babylon, as made by the second angel (Revelation 14:8), is

[602-605]

become darker, their hearts more stubborn, until they are entrenched in an infidel hardihood. In defiance of the warnings
which God has given, they continue to trample upon one of
the precepts of the decalogue, and they persecute those who
hold it sacred. Christ is set at naught in the contempt placed
upon His word and His people. As the teachings of Spiritualism are accepted by the churches, no real restraint is imposed upon the carnal heart, and the profession of religion
becomes a cloak to conceal the basest iniquity. A belief in
spiritual manifestations opens the door to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils. The influence of evil angels is
felt in the churches throughout the land.
Of Babylon at this time it is declared, “Her sins have
reached unto heaven, and God hath remembered her iniquities.” Revelation 18:5. She has filled up the measure of her
guilt, and destruction is about to fall upon her. But God still
has a people in Babylon; and before the visitation of His
judgments, these faithful ones must be called out, that
they “partake not of her sins, and receive not of her
plagues.” Hence the movement symbolized by the angel coming down from Heaven, lightening the earth with His glory,
and crying mightily with a strong voice, announcing the sins
of Babylon. In connection with His message the call is heard,
“Come out of her, My people.” As these warnings join the
third angel’s message, it swells to a loud cry.
Fearful is the issue to which the world is to be brought.
The powers of earth, uniting to war against the commandments of God, will decree that no man may buy or
sell, save he that has the mark of the beast, and, finally,
that whoever refuses to receive the mark shall be put to
death. Revelation 13:15, 17. The word of God declares: “If
any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his
mark in his forehead, or in his hand, the same shall drink of
the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without
mixture into the cup of His indignation.” Revelation 14:9,
10. But not one is made to feel the wrath of God until the
truth has been brought in contact with his mind and conscience, and has been rejected. There are many in the

374

The

Great

Controversy

churches of our country who have never, even in this land
of light and knowledge, had an opportunity to hear the
special truths for this time. The obligation of the fourth
commandment has never been set before them in its true
light. Jesus reads every heart, and tries every motive. The
decree is not to be urged upon the people blindly. Every one
is to have sufficient light to make his decision intelligently.
The Sabbath will be the great test of loyalty; for it is the
point of truth especially controverted.
Heretofore those who presented the truths of the third
message have often been regarded as mere alarmists. The
prediction that Church and State would unite to persecute
those who keep the commandments of God has been pronounced groundless and absurd. It has been confidently declared that this land could never become other than what it
has been, the defender of religious freedom. But as the question of enforcing Sunday observance is widely agitated, the
event so long doubted and disbelieved is seen to be approaching, and the third message produces an effect which it could
not have had before.
In every generation God has sent His servants to rebuke sin, both in the world and in the church. But the
people desire smooth things spoken to them, and the pure,
unvarnished truth is not acceptable. Many reformers, in
entering upon their work, determined to exercise great prudence in attacking the sins of the church and the nation. They
hoped, by the example of a pure Christian life, to lead the
people back to the doctrines of the Bible. But the Spirit of
God came upon them as it came upon Elijah, and they could
not refrain from preaching the plain utterances of the Bible,—
doctrines which they had been reluctant to present. They were
impelled to zealously declare the truth, and the danger which
threatened souls. The words which the Lord gave them
they uttered, fearless of consequences, and the people
were compelled to hear the warning.
Thus will the message of the third angel be proclaimed.
As the time comes for the loud cry to be given, the Lord
will work through humble instruments, leading the minds

The Loud Cry

[605-607]

375

of those who consecrate themselves to His service. The laborers will be qualified rather by the unction of His Spirit
than by the training of literary institutions. Men of faith and
prayer will be constrained to go forth with holy zeal, declaring the words which God gives them. The sins of Babylon
will be laid open. The fearful results of a union of Church
and State, the inroads of Spiritualism, the stealthy but
rapid progress of the papal power,—all will be unmasked.
By these solemn warnings the people will be stirred. Thousands upon thousands have never listened to words like these.
In amazement they hear the testimony that Babylon is the
church, fallen because of her errors and sins, because of her
rejection of the truth sent to her from Heaven. The people go
to their former teachers with the eager inquiry, Are these
things so? The ministers present fables, prophesy smooth
things, to soothe their fears, and quiet the awakened conscience. But many refuse to be satisfied with the mere authority of men, and demand a plain “Thus saith the Lord.”
The popular ministry, like the Pharisees of old, are filled with
anger as their authority is questioned; they denounce the
message as of Satan, and stir up the sin-loving multitudes to
revile and persecute those who proclaim it.
As the controversy extends into new fields, and the
minds of the people are called to God’s down-trodden
law, Satan is astir. The power attending the message only
maddens those who oppose it. The clergy put forth almost
superhuman efforts to shut away the light, lest it should shine
upon their flocks. By every means at their command they
endeavor to suppress the discussion of these vital questions.
The church appeals to the strong arm of civil power, and in
this work, papists are solicited to come to the help of Protestants. The movement for Sunday enforcement becomes
more bold and decided. The law is invoked against commandment-keepers. They are threatened with fines and imprisonment, and some are offered positions of influence, and
other rewards and advantages, as inducements to renounce
their faith. But their steadfast answer is, “Show us from the
word of God our error,”—the same plea that was made by

376

The

Great

Controversy

Luther under similar circumstances. Those who are arraigned
before the courts make a strong vindication of the truth, and
some who hear them are led to take their stand to keep all the
commandments of God. Thus light is brought before thousands who otherwise would know nothing of these truths.
Conscientious obedience to the word of God will be
treated as rebellion. Blinded by Satan, the parent will exercise harshness and severity toward the believing child; the
master or mistress will oppress the commandment-keeping
servant. Affection will be alienated; children will be disinherited, and driven from home. The words of Paul will be
literally fulfilled, “All that will live godly in Christ Jesus
shall suffer persecution.” 2 Timothy 3:12. As the defenders
of truth refuse to honor the Sunday-Sabbath, some of
them will be thrust into prison, some will be exiled, some
will be treated as slaves. To human wisdom, all this now
seems impossible; but as the restraining Spirit of God shall
be withdrawn from men, and they shall be under the control
of Satan, who hates the divine precepts, there will be strange
developments. The heart can be very cruel when God’s fear
and love are removed.
As the storm approaches, a large class who have professed faith in the third message, but have not been sanctified through it, abandon their position, and take refuge
under the banner of the powers of darkness. By uniting
with the world and partaking of its spirit, they come to view
matters in nearly the same light; and when the test is brought,
they are prepared to choose the easy, popular side. Men of
talent and pleasing address, who once rejoiced in the
truth, employ their powers to deceive and mislead souls.
They become the most bitter enemies of their former
brethren. When Sabbath-keepers are brought before the
courts to answer for their faith, these apostates are the most
efficient agents of Satan to misrepresent and accuse them,
and by false reports and insinuations to stir up the rulers
against them.
The Lord’s servants have faithfully given the warning, looking to God and to His word alone. They have

The Loud Cry

[607-610]

377

not coolly calculated the consequences to themselves.
They have not consulted their temporal interests, or
sought to preserve their reputation or their lives. Yet when
the storm of opposition and reproach bursts upon them, they
are overwhelmed with consternation; and some are ready to
exclaim, “Had we foreseen the consequences of our words,
we would have held our peace.” They are hedged in with
difficulties. Satan assails them with fierce temptations. The
work which they have undertaken seems far beyond their
ability to accomplish. They are threatened with destruction. The enthusiasm which animated them is gone; yet
they cannot turn back. Then, feeling their utter helplessness, they flee to the Mighty One for strength. They remember that the words which they have spoken were not
theirs, but His who bade them give the warning. God put the
truth into their hearts, and they could not forbear to proclaim it.
The same trials were experienced by men of God in ages
past. Wycliffe, Huss, Luther, Tyndale, Baxter, Wesley, urged
that all doctrines be brought to the test of the Bible, and
declared that they would renounce everything which it condemned. Against these men, persecution raged with relentless fury; yet they ceased not to declare the truth. Different
periods in the history of the church have each been
marked by the development of some special truth,
adapted to the necessities of the people of God at that
time. Every new truth has made its way against hatred
and opposition; those who were blessed with its light were
tempted and tried. The Lord gives a special truth for the
people in an emergency. Who dare refuse to publish it? He
commands His servants to present the last invitation of mercy
to the world. They cannot remain silent, except at the peril
of their souls. Christ’s ambassadors have nothing to do with
consequences. They must perform their duty, and leave results with God.
As the opposition rises to a fiercer height, the servants of
God are again perplexed; for it seems to them that they have
brought the crisis. But conscience and the word of God as-

378

The

Great

Controversy

sure them that their course is right; and although the trials
continue, they are strengthened to bear them. The contest
grows closer and sharper, but their faith and courage
rise with the emergency. Their testimony is, “We dare not
tamper with God’s word, dividing His holy law, calling one
portion essential and another non-essential to gain the favor
of the world. The Lord whom we serve is able to deliver us.
Christ has conquered the powers of earth; and shall we be
afraid of a world already conquered?”
Persecution in its varied forms is the development of
a principle which will exist as long as Satan exists, and
Christianity has vital power. No man can serve God without enlisting against himself the opposition of the hosts
of darkness. Evil angels will assail him, alarmed that his
influence is taking the prey from their hands. Evil men, rebuked by his example, will unite with them in seeking to
separate him from God by alluring temptations. When these
do not succeed, then a compelling power is employed to force
the conscience.
But as long as Jesus remains man’s intercessor in the
sanctuary above, the restraining influence of the Holy
Spirit is felt by rulers and people. It still controls, to some
extent, the laws of the land. Were it not for these laws, the
condition of the world would be much worse than it now is.
While many of our rulers are active agents of Satan, God
also has His agents among the leading men of the nation.
The enemy moves upon His servants to propose measures
that would greatly impede the work of God; but statesmen
who fear the Lord are influenced by holy angels to oppose
such propositions with unanswerable arguments. Thus a few
men will hold in check a powerful current of evil. The
opposition of the enemies of truth will be restrained that
the third message may do its work. When the loud cry
shall be given, it will arrest the attention of these leading
men through whom the Lord is now working, and some of
them will accept it, and will stand with the people of God
through the time of trouble.
The angel who unites in the proclamation of the third

The Loud Cry

[610-612]

379

message is to lighten the whole earth with His glory. A
work of world-wide extent and unwonted power is here
brought to view. The Advent movement of 1840-44 was a
glorious manifestation of the power of God; the first message was carried to every missionary station in the world,
and in this country there was the greatest religious interest
which has been witnessed in any land since the Reformation
of the sixteenth century; but these are to be far exceeded by
the mighty movement under the loud cry of the third message. The work will be similar to that of the day of Pentecost. Servants of God, with their faces lighted up and
shining with holy consecration, hasten from place to place
to proclaim the warning from Heaven. By thousands of
voices, all over the earth, the message will be given.
Miracles are wrought, the sick are healed, and signs and wonders follow the believers. Satan also works with lying wonders, even bringing down fire from heaven in the sight of
men. Thus the inhabitants of the earth are brought to
take their stand.
The message will be carried, as was the midnight cry
of 1844, not so much by argument as by the deep conviction of the Spirit of God. The arguments have been presented. The seed has been sown, and now it will spring up
and bear fruit. The publications distributed by missionary
workers have exerted their influence; yet many whose minds
have been impressed have been prevented from fully comprehending the truth or from yielding obedience. Now the
rays of light penetrate everywhere, the truth is seen in its
clearness, and the honest children of God sever the bands
which have held them. Family connections, church relations,
are powerless to stay them now. Truth is more precious
than all besides. Notwithstanding the agencies combined
against the truth, a large number take their stand upon
the Lord’s side.

The Bible Sabbath hit the headlines in New York City not too long ago. The following article appeared in the New York Times on March 14, 1966. The title in bold
type said this: “An earnest Appeal to the Pope of Rome to Lead Christians Back to
the Bible.” Here is that news article:
“Dr. Earnest R. Palen, pastor of one of New York’s largest churches, the Marble
Collegiate for more than thirty years, created a stir that hit the headlines, when on
March 13, 1966, he delivered a sermon in which he called for Protestants and Roman Catholics to join in returning to the Bible Sabbath that Jesus kept—on Saturday.
“This Reformed Church in America theologian and pastor startled hearers by
quoting from Exodus 20:8, and then saying, ‘It should not be too great a break for us
. . to observe the same Sabbath day that Jesus Himself observed.’
“In this sermon, he pled for all the churches to return to the keeping of the
seventh-day Sabbath, and noting that mankind can only truly keep holy that day
which the God of heaven has commanded to be kept holy, he said that this ‘one day
of the week really kept holy by Catholics, Protestants, and Jews would give an uplift
to the moral tone of our day that nothing else could do.’
“Dr. Palen, recognizing the well-known leadership of the pope in Sunday sanctification, asked that Pope Paul VI take the initiative in this matter. Dr. Palen predicted
that if the pontiff would designate ‘the seventh day—the historical and Biblical Sabbath—as the day to keep holy,’ that most of the major Protestant bodies of our time
would ‘go along.’ ” Article by George Dugan, New York Times, March 14, 1966.
“But in vain do they worship Me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of
men.” Matthew 15:9.
“He said unto them, Full well ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may
keep your own tradition.” Mark 7:9 (Acts 4:19-20; Isaiah 8:20; Acts 5:27-29; Rev
21:14).
“Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the
truth.” 1 Timothy 2:4.
“To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word, it is
because there is no light in them.” Isaiah 8:20.
“Prove all things; hold fast that which is good.” 1 Thessalonians 5:21.
“He that turneth away his ear from hearing the law, even his prayer shall be
abomination.” Proverbs 28:9 (Isa 26:2; John 8:31-32).
“Ye do err, not knowing the Scriptures.” Matthew 22:29. “For the time will come
when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to
themselves teachers, having itching ears; and they shall turn away their ears from
the truth, and shall be turned unto fables.” 2 Timothy 4:3-4.
“Thy Word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.” Psalm 119:105.
“Sanctify them through Thy truth: Thy Word is truth.” John 17:17. Isaiah 8:20.
“Heaven and earth shall pass away, but My words shall not pass away.” Matthew 24:35.

— The Time of Trouble

The time is coming—and is just ahead—when mercy will no

Everyy case will have

been decided—either for life or for death.
Some will be ready, others will not; but for all—probation will

days of Noah and of Sodom. Crime and lawlessness are filling the
earth —
soon—veryy soon—probation is to close. Many in the
But soon—ver

———————————————————————
“At that time shall Michael stand up, the great prince
which standeth for the children of thy people: and there
shall be a time of trouble, such as never was since there
was a nation even to that same time; and at that time thy
people shall be delivered, every one that shall be found written in the book.” Daniel 12:1.
When the third message closes, mercy no longer pleads
for the guilty inhabitants of the earth. The people of God
have accomplished their work; they have received the
latter rain, or the refreshing from the presence of the
Lord, and they are prepared for the trying hour before
them. Angels are hurrying to and fro in Heaven. An angel
returning from the earth announces that his work is done,
that the seal of God has been placed upon His people. Then
Jesus ceases His intercession in the sanctuary above. He
lifts His hands, and with a loud voice says, “It is done;”
and all the angelic host lay off their crowns as He makes the

382

The

solemn announcement: “He that is unjust, let him be unjust
still; and he which is filthy, let him be filthy still; and he that
is righteous, let him be righteous still; and he that is holy, let
him be holy still.” Revelation 22:11. Every case has been
decided for life or death. Christ has made the atonement
for His people, and blotted out their sins. The number of
His subjects is made up; “the kingdom and dominion and
the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven,” is
about to be given to the heirs of salvation, and Jesus is to
reign as King of kings and Lord of lords.
When He leaves the sanctuary, darkness covers the
inhabitants of the earth. In that fearful time the righteous must live in the sight of a holy God without an intercessor. The restraint which has been upon the wicked
is removed, and Satan has entire control of the finally
impenitent. The power attending the last warning has enraged them, and their anger is kindled against all who have
received the message. The people of God are then plunged
into those scenes of affliction and distress described by
the prophet as the time of Jacob’s trouble:
“Thus saith the Lord: We have heard a voice of trembling, of fear, and not of peace.” “All faces are turned into
paleness. Alas! for that day is great, so that none is like it: it
is even the time of Jacob’s trouble; but he shall be saved out
of it.” Jeremiah 30:5, 7.
Jacob’s night of anguish, when he wrestled in prayer
for deliverance from the hand of Esau (Genesis 32:2430), represents the experience of God’s people in the time
of trouble. Because of the deception practiced to secure his
father’s blessing, intended for Esau, Jacob had fled for his
life, alarmed by his brother’s deadly threats. After remaining for many years an exile, he had set out, at God’s command, to return with his wives and children, his flocks and
herds, to his native country. On reaching the borders of the
land, he was filled with terror by the tidings of Esau’s approach at the head of a band of warriors, doubtless bent upon
revenge. Jacob’s company, unarmed and defenseless, seemed
about to fall helpless victims of violence and slaughter. And

The T
ime of T
Time
Trr ouble

[613-618]

383

to the burden of anxiety and fear was added the crushing
weight of self-reproach; for it was his own sin that had
brought this danger. His only hope was in the mercy of God;
his only defense must be prayer. Yet he leaves nothing undone on his own part to atone for the wrong to his brother,
and to avert the threatened danger. So should the followers
of Christ, as they approach the time of trouble, make
every exertion to place themselves in a proper light before the people, to disarm prejudice, and to avert the
danger which threatens liberty of conscience.
Having sent his family away, that they may not witness
his distress, Jacob remains alone to intercede with God. He
confesses his sin, and gratefully acknowledges the mercy of
God toward him, while with deep humiliation he pleads the
covenant made with his fathers, and the promises to himself
in the night vision at Bethel and in the land of his exile. The
crisis in his life has come; everything is at stake. In the darkness and solitude he continues praying and humbling himself before God. Suddenly a hand is laid upon his shoulder.
He thinks that an enemy is seeking his life, and with all the
energy of despair he wrestles with his assailant. As the day
begins to break, the stranger puts forth his superhuman
power; at his touch the strong man seems paralyzed, and he
falls, a helpless, weeping suppliant, upon the neck of his
mysterious antagonist. Jacob knows now that it is the Angel
of the covenant with whom he has been in conflict. Though
disabled, and suffering the keenest pain, he does not relinquish his purpose. Long has he endured perplexity, remorse,
and trouble for his sin; now he must have the assurance that
it is pardoned. The divine visitant seems about to depart;
but Jacob clings to him, pleading for a blessing. The Angel
urges, “Let me go; for the day breaketh;” but the patriarch
exclaims, “I will not let thee go, except Thou bless me.” What
confidence, what firmness and perseverance, are here displayed! Had this been a boastful, presumptuous claim, Jacob
would have been instantly destroyed; but his was the assurance of one who confesses his weakness and unworthiness,
yet trusts the mercy of a covenant-keeping God.

384

The

Great

Controversy

“He had power over the Angel, and prevailed.” Hosea
12:4. Through humiliation, repentance, and self-surrender,
this sinful, erring mortal prevailed with the Majesty of
Heaven. He had fastened his trembling grasp upon the promises of God, and the heart of Infinite Love could not turn
away the sinner’s plea. As an evidence of his triumph, and
an encouragement to others to imitate his example, his name
was changed from one which was a reminder of his sin, to
one that commemorated his victory. And the fact that Jacob
had prevailed with God was an assurance that he would prevail with men. He no longer feared to encounter his brother’s
anger; for the Lord was his defense.
Satan had accused Jacob before the angels of God,
claiming the right to destroy him because of his sin; he
had moved upon Esau to march against him; and during
the patriarch’s long night of wrestling, Satan endeavored to force upon him a sense of his guilt, in order to
discourage him, and break his hold upon God. Jacob was
driven almost to despair; but he knew that without help from
Heaven he must perish. He had sincerely repented of his great
sin, and he appealed to the mercy of God. He would not be
turned from his purpose, but held fast the Angel, and urged
his petition with earnest, agonizing cries, until he prevailed.
Heavenly messengers were sent to move upon Esau’s heart,
and his purpose of hatred and revenge was changed to fraternal affection.
As Satan influenced Esau to march against Jacob, so
he will stir up the wicked to destroy God’s people in the
time of trouble. And as he accused Jacob, he will urge
his accusations against the people of God. He numbers
the world as his subjects; but the little company who keep
the commandments of God are resisting his supremacy. If he
could blot them from the earth, his triumph would be complete. He sees that holy angels are guarding them, and he
infers that their sins have been pardoned; but he does not
know that their cases have been decided in the sanctuary
above. He has an accurate knowledge of the sins which he
has tempted them to commit, and he presents these before

The T
ime of T
Time
Trr ouble

[618-620]

385

God in the most exaggerated light, representing this people
to be just as deserving as himself of exclusion from the favor of God. He declares that the Lord cannot in justice forgive their sins, and yet destroy him and his angels. He claims
them as his prey, and demands that they be given into his
hands to destroy.
As Satan accuses the people of God on account of their
sins, the Lord permits him to try them to the uttermost.
Their confidence in God, their faith and firmness, will be
severely tested. As they review the past, their hopes sink; for
in their whole lives they can see little good. They are fully
conscious of their weakness and unworthiness. Satan endeavors to terrify them with the thought that their cases are
hopeless, that the stain of their defilement will never be
washed away. He hopes to so destroy their faith that they
will yield to his temptations, and turn from their allegiance
to God.
Though God’s people will be surrounded by enemies
who are bent upon their destruction, yet the anguish
which they suffer is not a dread of persecution for the
truth’s sake; they fear that every sin has not been repented of, and that through some fault in themselves they
shall fail to realize the fulfillment of the Saviour’s promise, “I will keep thee from the hour of temptation which shall
come upon all the world.” If they could have the assurance
of pardon, they would not shrink from torture or death; but
should they prove unworthy, and lose their lives because of
their own defects of character, then God’s holy name would
be reproached.
On every hand they hear the plottings of treason, and
see the active working of rebellion; and there is aroused
within them an intense desire, an earnest yearning of soul,
that this great apostasy may be terminated, and the wickedness of the wicked may come to an end. But while they
plead with God to stay the work of rebellion, there is a throb
of self-reproach that they themselves have no more power to
resist and urge back the mighty tide of evil. They feel that
had they always employed all their ability in the service of

386

The

Great

Controversy

Christ, going forward from strength to strength, Satan’s
forces would have less power to prevail against them.
They afflict their souls before God, pointing to their
past repentance of their many sins, and pleading the
Saviour’s promise, “Let him take hold of My strength, that
he may make peace with Me, and he shall make peace with
Me.” Isaiah 27:5. Their faith does not fail because their
prayers are not immediately answered. Though suffering the
keenest anxiety, terror, and distress, they do not cease their
intercessions. They lay hold of the strength of God as Jacob
laid hold of the Angel; and the language of their souls is, “I
will not let Thee go, except Thou bless me.”
Had not Jacob previously repented of his sin in obtaining the birthright by fraud, God would not have
heard his prayer and mercifully preserved his life. So in
the time of trouble, if the people of God had unconfessed
sins to appear before them while tortured with fear and
anguish, they would be overwhelmed; despair would cut
off their faith, and they could not have confidence to plead
with God for deliverance. But while they have a deep sense
of their unworthiness, they have no concealed wrongs to
reveal. Their sins have gone beforehand to Judgment,
and have been blotted out; and they cannot bring them
to remembrance.
Satan leads many to believe that God will overlook their
unfaithfulness in the minor affairs of life; but the Lord shows
in His dealings with Jacob that He will in no wise sanction
or tolerate evil. All who endeavor to excuse or conceal
their sins, and permit them to remain upon the books of
Heaven, unconfessed and unforgiven, will be overcome
by Satan. The more exalted their profession, and the more
honorable the position which they hold, the more grievous is
their course in the sight of God, and the more sure the triumph of their great adversary. Those who delay a preparation for the day of God cannot obtain it in the time of
trouble or at any subsequent time. The case of all such is
hopeless. Those professed Christians who come up to that
last fearful conflict unprepared, will, in their despair, con-

The T
ime of T
Time
Trr ouble

[620-622]

387

fess their sins in words of burning anguish, while the wicked
exult over their distress.
Yet Jacob’s history is an assurance that God will not
cast off those who have been deceived and tempted and
betrayed into sin, but who have returned unto Him with
true repentance. While Satan seeks to destroy this class,
God will send his angels to comfort and protect them in the
time of peril. The assaults of Satan are fierce and determined,
his delusions are terrible; but the Lord’s eye is upon His
people, and His ear listens to their cries. Their affliction is
great, the flames of the furnace seem about to consume them;
but the Refiner will bring them forth as gold tried in the fire.
God’s love for His children during the period of their severest trial is as strong and tender as in the days of their sunniest prosperity; but it is needful for them to be placed in the
furnace fire; their earthliness must be removed that the image of Christ may be perfectly reflected.
The season of distress and anguish before us will require a faith that can endure weariness, delay, and hunger,—a faith that will not faint, though severely tried.
The period of probation is granted to all to prepare for that
time. Jacob prevailed because he was persevering and determined. His victory is an evidence of the power of importunate prayer. All who will lay hold of God’s promises as he
did, and be as earnest and persevering as he was, will
succeed as he succeeded. Those who are unwilling to deny
self, to agonize before God, to pray long and earnestly
for His blessing, will not obtain it. Wrestling with God—
how few know what it is! How few have ever had their souls
drawn out after God with intensity of desire until every power
is on the stretch. When waves of despair which no language
can express sweep over the suppliant, how few cling with
unyielding faith to the promises of God.
Those who exercise but little faith now, are in the greatest danger of falling under the power of Satanic delusions and the decree to compel the conscience. And even
if they endure the test, they will be plunged into deeper distress and anguish in the time of trouble, because they have

388

The

Great

Controversy

never made it a habit to trust in God. The lessons of faith
which they have neglected, they will be forced to learn under
a terrible pressure of discouragement.
We should now acquaint ourselves with God by proving His promises. Angels record every prayer that is earnest and sincere. We should rather dispense with selfish gratifications than neglect communion with God. The deepest
poverty, the greatest self-denial, with His approval, is better
than riches, honors, ease, and friendship without it. We must
take time to pray. If we allow our minds to be absorbed by
worldly interests, the Lord may give us time by removing
from us our idols of gold, of houses, or of fertile lands.
The young would not be seduced into sin if they would
refuse to enter any path, save that upon which they could
ask God’s blessing. If the messengers who bear the last solemn warning to the world would pray for the blessing of
God, not in a cold, listless, lazy manner, but fervently and in
faith, as did Jacob, they would find many places where they
could say, “I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.” They would be accounted of Heaven as princes,
having power to prevail with God and with men.
The time of trouble such as never was, is soon to open
upon us; and we shall need an experience which we do
not now possess, and which many are too indolent to
obtain. It is often the case that trouble is greater in anticipation than in reality; but this is not true of the crisis before us.
The most vivid presentation cannot reach the magnitude of
the ordeal. And now, while the precious Saviour is making
an atonement for us, we should seek to become perfect in
Christ. God’s providence is the school in which we are to
learn the meekness and lowliness of Jesus. The Lord is ever
setting before us, not the way we would choose, which is
easier and pleasanter to us, but the true aims of life. None
can neglect or defer this work but at the most fearful peril to
their souls.
The apostle John in vision heard a loud voice in Heaven
exclaiming, “Woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the
sea! for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath,

The T
Time
Trr ouble
ime of T

[622-624]

389

because he knoweth that he hath but a short time.” Revelation 12:12. Fearful are the scenes which call forth this exclamation from the heavenly voice. The wrath of Satan increases
as his time grows short, and his work of deceit and destruction reaches its culmination in the time of trouble. God’s
long-suffering has ended. The world has rejected His
mercy, despised His love, and trampled upon His law.
The wicked have passed the boundary of their probation, and the Lord withdraws His protection, and leaves
them to the mercy of the leader they have chosen. Satan
will have power over those who have yielded themselves to
his control, and he will plunge the inhabitants of the earth
into one great, final trouble. As the angels of God cease to
hold in check the fierce winds of human passion, all the elements of strife will be let loose. The whole world will be
involved in ruin more terrible than that which came upon
Jerusalem of old.
A single angel destroyed all the first-born of the Egyptians, and filled the land with mourning. When David offended against God by numbering the people, one angel
caused that terrible destruction by which his sin was punished. The same destructive power exercised by holy angels when God commands, will be exercised by evil angels when He allows. There are forces now ready, and
only waiting the divine permission, to spread desolation
everywhere.
Fearful sights of a supernatural character will soon
be revealed in the heavens, in token of the power of
miracle-working demons. The spirits of devils will go forth
to the kings of the earth and to the whole world. Rulers and
subjects will be alike deceived. Persons will arise pretending
to be Christ, and claiming the title and the worship which
belong to the world’s Redeemer. They will perform wonderful miracles of healing, and will profess to have revelations
from Heaven contradicting the testimony of the Scriptures.
As the crowning act in the great drama of deception,
Satan himself will attempt to personate Christ. The church
has long professed to look to the Saviour’s advent as the

390

The

Great

Controversy

consummation of her hopes. Now the great deceiver will make
it appear that Christ has come. In different parts of the earth,
Satan will manifest himself among men as a majestic being
of dazzling brightness, resembling the description of the Son
of God given by John in the Revelation. Revelation 1:13-15.
The glory that surrounds him is unsurpassed by anything
that mortal eyes have yet beheld. The shout of triumph rings
out upon the air, “Christ has come! Christ has come!” The
people prostrate themselves in adoration before him, while
he lifts up his hands, and pronounces a blessing upon them,
as Christ blessed His disciples when He was personally upon
the earth. His voice is soft and subdued, yet full of melody.
In gentle, compassionate tones he presents some of the same
gracious, heavenly truths which the Saviour uttered; he heals
the diseases of the people, and then, in his assumed character of Christ, he claims to have changed the Sabbath to Sunday, and commands all to hallow the day which he has blessed.
He declares that those who persist in keeping holy the seventh day are blaspheming his name by refusing to listen to
his angels sent to them with light and truth. This is the strong,
almost overmastering delusion. Like the Samaritans who
were deceived by Simon Magus, the multitudes, from the
least to the greatest, give heed to these sorceries, saying, This
is “the great power of God.”
But the people of God will not be misled. The teachings of this false christ are not in accordance with the
Scriptures. His blessing is pronounced upon the worshipers of the beast and his image,—the very class upon whom
the Bible declares that God’s unmingled wrath shall be poured
out. And, furthermore, Satan is not permitted to counterfeit the manner of Christ’s advent. The Scriptures teach
that “as the lightning cometh out of the east, and shineth
even unto the west; so shall also the coming of the Son of
man be;” (Matthew 24:27) that He “cometh with clouds;
and every eye shall see Him;” (Revelation 1:7) that He will
“descend from Heaven with a shout, with the voice of the
archangel, and with the trump of God;” (1 Thessalonians
4:16) that He will “come in His glory, and all the holy angels

The T
ime of T
Time
Trr ouble

[624-626]

391

with Him,” (Matthew 25:31) and will “send His angels with
a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together
His elect.” Matthew 24:31. Those who have received the
love of the truth will be shielded from the powerful delusion
that takes the world captive. By the testimony of the Scriptures they will detect the deceiver in his disguise.
To all, the testing time will come. By the sifting of temptation, the genuine Christian will be revealed. Are the
people of God now so firmly established upon His word that
they would not yield to the evidence of their senses? Would
they, in such a crisis, cling to the Bible, and the Bible only?
Satan will, if possible, prevent them from obtaining a preparation to stand in that day. He will so arrange affairs as to
hedge up their way, entangle them with earthly treasures,
cause them to carry a heavy, wearisome burden, that their
hearts may be overcharged with the cares of this life, and the
day of trial may come upon them as a thief.
Satan will continue to act a double part. Appearing to
be the dispenser of great blessings and divine truths, he
will, by his lying wonders, hold the world under his control; and at the same time he will indulge his malignity by
causing distress and destruction, and will accuse God’s people
as the cause of the fearful convulsions of nature and the strife
and bloodshed among men which are desolating the earth.
Thus he will excite to greater intensity the spirit of hatred
and persecution against them. God never forces the will or
the conscience; but Satan will employ the most cruel
measures to control the consciences of men, and to secure worship to himself. And this work of compulsion is
always in favor of human creeds and laws, and in defiance of God’s holy law.
In the last conflict the Sabbath will be the special point
of controversy throughout all Christendom. Secular rulers and religious leaders will unite to enforce the observance of the Sunday; and as milder measures fail, the most
oppressive laws will be enacted. It will be urged that the few
who stand in opposition to an institution of the church and a
law of the land ought not to be tolerated, and a decree will

392

The

Great

Controversy

finally be issued denouncing them as deserving of the
severest punishment, and giving the people liberty, after
a certain time, to put them to death. Romanism in the Old
World, and apostate Protestantism in the New, will pursue a
similar course toward those who honor the divine precepts.
The people of God will then flee from the cities and
villages, and associate together in companies, dwelling
in the most desolate and solitary places. Many will find
refuge in the strongholds of the mountains. Like the Christians of the Piedmont valleys, they will make the high places
of the earth their sanctuaries, and will thank God for the
“munitions of rocks.” But many of all nations and all classes,
high and low, rich and poor, black and white, will be cast
into the most unjust and cruel bondage. The beloved of God
pass weary days, bound in chains, shut in by prison bars,
sentenced to be slain, some apparently left to die of starvation in dark and loathsome dungeons. No human ear is open
to hear their moans; no human hand is ready to lend them
help.
Will the Lord forget His people in this trying hour?
Did He forget faithful Noah when judgments were visited upon the antediluvian world? Did He forget Lot when
the fire came down from heaven to consume the cities of the
plain? Did He forget Joseph surrounded by idolaters in
Egypt? Did He forget Elijah when the oath of Jezebel threatened him with the fate of the Baal prophets? Did He forget
Jeremiah in the dark and dismal pit of his prison-house? Did
He forget the three worthies in the fiery furnace? or Daniel
in the den of lions? Christ cannot forsake those who are
as the apple of His eye, the purchase of His precious
blood.
Though the people of God endure privation, and even
suffer for want of food, they are not left to perish. While
God’s judgments are visited upon the earth, and the wicked
are dying from hunger and thirst, angels provide the righteous with food and water. Said Jesus, in His lessons of faith
to His disciples: “Consider the ravens; for they neither sow
nor reap; which neither have storehouse nor barn; and God

The T
ime of T
Time
Trr ouble

[626-631]

393

feedeth them; how much more are ye better than the fowls?”
Luke 12:24. “Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and
one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father.
But the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear ye not
therefore, ye are of more value than many sparrows.” Matthew 10:29-31.
Yet to human sight it will appear that the people of
God must soon seal their testimony with their blood, as
did the martyrs before them. They themselves begin to
fear that the Lord has left them to fall by the hand of their
enemies. It is a time of fearful agony. Day and night they cry
unto God for deliverance. The wicked exult, and the jeering
cry is heard, “Where now is your faith? Why does not God
deliver you out of our hands if you are indeed His people?”
But the waiting ones remember Jesus dying upon Calvary’s
cross, and the chief priests and rulers shouting in mockery,
“He saved others; Himself He cannot save. If He be the King
of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will
believe Him.” Matthew 27:42. Like Jacob, all are wrestling
with God. Their countenances express their internal struggle.
Paleness sits upon every face. Yet they cease not their earnest intercession.
Could men see with heavenly vision, they would behold companies of angels that excel in strength stationed
about those who have kept the word of Christ’s patience.
With sympathizing tenderness, angels have witnessed their
distress, and have heard their prayers. They are waiting the
word of their Commander to snatch them from their peril.
But they must wait yet a little longer. The people of God
must drink of the cup, and be baptized with the baptism.
The very delay, so painful to them, is the best answer to their
petitions. As they endeavor to wait trustingly for the Lord to
work, they are led to exercise faith, hope, and patience, which
have been too little exercised during their religious experience. Yet for the elect’s sake, the time of trouble will be
shortened. The end will come more quickly than men expect. The wheat will be gathered and bound in sheaves for
the garner of God; the tares will be bound as fagots for the

394

The

Great

Controversy

fires of destruction.
The heavenly sentinels, faithful to their trust, continue
their watch. In some cases, before the time specified in the
decree, enemies will rush upon the waiting ones to put them
to death. But none can pass the mighty guardians stationed
about every faithful soul. Some are assailed in their flight
from the cities and villages; but the swords raised against
them break and fall as powerless as a straw. Others are defended by angels in the form of men of war.
In all ages God has wrought through holy angels for
the succor and deliverance of His people. Celestial beings have taken an active part in the affairs of men. They
have appeared clothed in garments that shone as the lightning; they have come as men, in the garb of wayfarers. Angels have appeared in human form to men of God. They have
rested, as if weary, under the oaks at noon. They have accepted the hospitalities of human homes. They have acted as
guides to benighted travelers. They have, with their own
hands, kindled the fires of the altar. They have opened prison
doors, and set free the servants of the Lord. Clothed with the
panoply of Heaven, they came to roll away the stone from
the Saviour’s tomb.
In the form of men, angels are often in the assemblies
of the righteous, and they visit the assemblies of the
wicked, as they went to Sodom, to make a record of their
deeds, to determine whether they have passed the boundary
of God’s forbearance. The Lord delights in mercy; and for
the sake of a few who really serve Him, He restrains calamities, and prolongs the tranquillity of multitudes. Little do
sinners against God realize that they are indebted for their
own lives to the faithful few whom they delight to ridicule
and oppress.
Though the rulers of this world know it not, yet often
in their councils angels have been spokesmen. Human
eyes have looked upon them; human ears have listened
to their appeals; human lips have opposed their suggestions and ridiculed their counsels; human hands have met
them with insult and abuse. In the council hall and the court

The T
ime of T
Time
Trr ouble

[631-633]

395

of justice, these heavenly messengers have shown an intimate acquaintance with human history; they have proved
themselves better able to plead the cause of the oppressed
than their ablest and most eloquent defenders. They have
defeated purposes and arrested evils that would have greatly
retarded the work of God, and would have caused great suffering to His people. In the hour of peril and distress let it
never be forgotten that “the angel of the Lord encampeth
round about them that fear Him, and delivereth them.” Psalm
34:7.
With earnest longing, God’s people await the tokens
of their coming King. As the watchmen are accosted, “What
of the night?” the answer is given unfalteringly, “ ‘The morning cometh, and also the night.’ Light is gleaming upon the
clouds above the mountain tops. Soon will there be a revealing of His glory. The Sun of Righteousness is about to shine
forth. The morning and the night come hand in hand,—the
opening of endless day to the righteous, the settling down of
eternal night to the wicked.”
As the wrestling ones urge their petitions before God, the
vail separating them from the unseen seems almost withdrawn. The heavens glow with the dawning of eternal day,
and, like the melody of angel songs, the words fall upon the
ear, “Stand fast to your allegiance. Help is coming.” Christ,
the almighty victor, holds out to His weary soldiers a crown
of immortal glory; and His voice comes from the gates ajar:
“Lo, I am with you. Be not afraid. I am acquainted with all
your sorrows; I have borne your griefs. You are not warring
against untried enemies. I have fought the battle in your behalf, and in My name you are more than conquerors.”
The precious Saviour will send help just when we need
it. The way to Heaven is consecrated by His footprints.
Every thorn that wounds our feet has wounded His. Every
cross that we are called to bear, He has borne before us. The
Lord permits conflicts, to prepare the soul for peace. If we
had no storms, no shadows, we could not appreciate the sunshine. The time of trouble is a fearful ordeal for God’s
people; but it is the time for every true believer to look

396

The

Great

Controversy

up, and by faith he may see the bow of promise encircling him.
“The redeemed of the Lord shall return, and come with
singing unto Zion; and everlasting joy shall be upon their
head; they shall obtain gladness and joy; and sorrow and
mourning shall flee away. I, even I, am He that comforteth
you; who art thou, that thou shouldst be afraid of a man that
shall die, and of the son of man which shall be made as grass;
and forgettest the Lord thy Maker; . . . and hast feared continually every day because of the fury of the oppressor, as if
he were ready to destroy? and where is the fury of the oppressor? The captive exile hasteneth that he may be loosed,
and that he should not die in the pit, nor that his bread should
fail. But I am the Lord thy God, that divided the sea, whose
waves roared. The Lord of hosts is His name. And I have put
My words in thy mouth, and I have covered thee in the shadow
of mine hand.”
“Therefore hear now this, thou afflicted and drunken, but
not with wine: Thus saith thy Lord the Lord, and thy God
that pleadeth the cause of His people, Behold, I have taken
out of thine hand the cup of trembling, even the dregs of the
cup of My fury; thou shalt no more drink it again. But I will
put it into the hand of them that afflict thee; which have said
to thy soul, Bow down, that we may go over: and thou hast
laid thy body as the ground, and as the street, to them that
went over.” Isaiah 51:11-16, 21-23.
The eye of God, looking down the ages, was fixed upon
the crisis which His people are to meet, when earthly
powers shall be arrayed against them. Like the captive
exile, they will be in fear of death by starvation or by violence. But the Holy One who divided the Red Sea before
Israel, will manifest His mighty power and turn their captivity. “They shall be mine, saith the Lord of hosts, in that day
when I make up My jewels; and I will spare them, as a man
spareth His own son that serveth Him.” Malachi 3:17. If the
blood of Christ’s faithful witnesses were shed at this time,
it would not, like the blood of the martyrs, be as seed
sown to yield a harvest for God. Their fidelity would not

The T
ime of T
Time
Trr ouble

[633-634]

397

be a testimony to convince others of the truth; for the
obdurate heart has beaten back the waves of mercy until they return no more. If the righteous were now left to
fall a prey to their enemies, it would be a triumph for the
prince of darkness. But Christ has spoken: “Come, My
people, enter thou into thy chambers, and shut thy doors about
thee; hide thyself as it were for a little moment, until the
indignation be overpast. For, behold, the Lord cometh out of
His place to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity.” Isaiah 26:20, 21. Glorious will be the deliverance of
those who have patiently waited for Him, and whose
names are written in the book of life.

The Coming

— God’s People Delivered

———————————————————————

The eyes of Heaven are fixed on the crisis just ahead, and at
its height—God will step in. Revelation has ominous prophecies
that apply to our time and beyond. Learn of that time when the
protection of human laws shall be withdrawn from those who
honor the W
ord of God
God, and there is a simultaneous movement for
Word
their destruction —
And learn of that time, just beyond, when the firmament
seems filled with radiant forms as Jesus returns for His own,
His countenance outshining the dazzling brightness of the noonday sun,—as the King of kings descends upon a cloud, wrapped
in flaming fire —

———————————————————————

As the time appointed in the decree against God’s
people comes, the inhabitants of the earth unite to destroy the disturbers of their peace. In one night they determine to strike the decisive blow that shall forever silence the voice of the reprover. The waiting ones, in their
solitary retreats, are still pleading for divine protection. In
every quarter, companies of armed men, urged on by hosts
of evil angels, are preparing for the work of death. With
shouts of triumph, with jeers and imprecations, they are
about to rush upon their prey.
But lo, a dense blackness, deeper than the darkness of
the night, falls upon the earth. Then a rainbow, shining
with the glory from the throne of God, spans the heavens,
and seems to encircle each praying company. The angry
multitudes are suddenly arrested. Their mocking cries die

God’s

People

Delivered

[635-637]

399

away. The objects of their murderous rage are forgotten. With
fearful forebodings they gaze upon the symbol of God’s covenant, and long to be shielded from its overpowering brightness.
By the people of God a voice, clear and melodious, is
heard, saying, “Look up,” and, lifting their eyes to the heavens, they behold the bow of promise. The black, angry
clouds that covered the firmament are parted, and like
Stephen they look up steadfastly into Heaven, and see
the glory of God, and the Son of man seated upon His
throne. In His divine form they discern the marks of His
humiliation; and from His lips they hear the request, presented before His Father and the holy angels, “I will that
they also, whom Thou hast given Me, be with Me where I
am,” Again a voice, musical and triumphant, is heard, saying, “They come! they come! holy, harmless, and undefiled.
They have kept the word of My patience; they shall walk
among the angels;” and the pale, quivering lips of those who
have held fast their faith, utter a shout of victory.
It is at midnight that God manifests His power for the
deliverance of His people. The sun appears shining in its
strength. Startling signs and wonders follow in quick
succession. The wicked look with terror and amazement
upon the scene, while the righteous behold with solemn
joy the tokens of their deliverance. Everything in nature
seems turned out of its course. The streams cease to flow.
Dark, heavy clouds come up, and clash against each other.
In the midst of the angry heavens is one clear space of
indescribable glory, whence comes the voice of God like
the sound of many waters, saying, “It is done.”
That voice shakes the heavens and the earth. There is
a mighty earthquake. The firmament appears to open and
shut. The glory from the throne of God seems flashing
through. The mountains shake like a reed in the wind, and
ragged rocks are scattered on every side. There is a roar as
of a coming tempest. The sea is lashed into fury. There is
heard the shriek of the hurricane, like the voice of demons
upon a mission of destruction. The whole earth heaves and

400

The

Great

Controversy

swells like the waves of the sea. Its surface is breaking up.
Its very foundations seem to be giving way. Mountain chains
are sinking. Inhabited islands disappear with their living
freight. The seaports that have become like Sodom for wickedness are swallowed up by the angry waters. Great hailstones, every one “about the weight of a talent,” (Revelation
16:21) are doing their work of destruction. The proudest cities of the earth are laid low. The costly palaces, upon which
the world’s great men have lavished their wealth in order to
glorify themselves, are crumbling to ruin before their eyes.
Prison walls are rent asunder, and God’s people, who have
been held in bondage for their faith, are set free.
Graves are opened, and “many of them that sleep in
the dust of the earth” “awake, some to everlasting life,
and some to shame and everlasting contempt.” Daniel
12:2. All who have died in faith under the third angel’s message come forth from the tomb glorified, to hear God’s covenant of peace with those who have kept His law. “They also
which pierced Him,” those that mocked and derided Christ’s
dying agonies, and the most violent opposers of His truth
and His people, are raised to behold Him in His glory, and to
see the honor placed upon the loyal and obedient.
Thick clouds still cover the sky; yet the sun now and
then breaks through, appearing like the avenging eye of
Jehovah. Fierce lightnings leap from the heavens, enveloping the earth in a sheet of flame. Above the terrific roar of
thunder, voices, mysterious and awful, declare the doom of
the wicked. The words spoken are not comprehended by all;
but they are distinctly understood by the false watchmen.
Those who a little before were so reckless, so boastful and
defiant, so exultant in their cruelty to God’s commandmentkeeping people, are now overwhelmed with consternation,
and shuddering in fear. Their wails are heard above the sound
of the elements. Demons acknowledge the divinity of Christ,
and tremble before His power, while men are supplicating
for mercy, and groveling in abject terror.
Said the prophets of old as they beheld in holy vision the
day of God: “Blow ye the trumpet in Zion, and sound an

alarm in My holy mountain: let all the inhabitants of the land
tremble; for the day of the Lord cometh, for it is nigh at
hand.” “And the Lord shall utter His voice before His army;
for His camp is very great; for He is strong that executeth
His word; for the day of the Lord is great and very terrible;
and who can abide it?” Joel 2:1, 11. “Howl ye; for the day of
the Lord is at hand; it shall come as a destruction from the
Almighty.” Isaiah 13:6. “Enter into the rock, and hide thee
in the dust, for fear of the Lord, and for the glory of His
majesty. The lofty looks of man shall be humbled, and the
haughtiness of men shall be bowed down, and the Lord alone
shall be exalted in that day. For the day of the Lord of hosts
shall be upon every one that is proud and lofty, and upon
every one that is lifted up; and he shall be brought low.”
Isaiah 2:10-12. “In that day a man shall cast his idols of
silver, and his idols of gold, which they made each one for
himself to worship, to the moles and to the bats; to go into
the clefts of the rocks, and into the tops of the ragged rocks,
for fear of the Lord, and for the glory of His majesty, when
He ariseth to shake terribly the earth.” Isaiah 2:20, 21.
Through a rift in the clouds, there beams a star whose
brilliancy is increased fourfold in contrast with the darkness. It speaks hope and joy to the faithful, but severity and
wrath to the transgressors of God’s law. Those who have
sacrificed all for Christ are now secure, hidden as in the secret of the Lord’s pavilion. They have been tested, and before the world and the despisers of truth they have evinced
their fidelity to Him who died for them. A marvelous change
has come over those who have held fast their integrity in
the very face of death. They have been suddenly delivered from the dark and terrible tyranny of men transformed to demons. Their faces, so lately pale, anxious,
and haggard, are now aglow with wonder, faith, and love.
Their voices rise in triumphant song: “God is our refuge and
strength, a very present help in trouble. Therefore will not
we fear, though the earth be removed, and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea; though the waters
thereof roar and be troubled, though the mountains shake

402

with the swelling thereof.” Psalm 46:1-3.
While these words of holy trust ascend to God, the
clouds sweep back, and the starry heavens are seen, unspeakably glorious in contrast with the black and angry
firmament on either side. The glory of Heaven is beaming
from the gates ajar. Then there appears against the sky a
hand holding two tables of stone folded together. The
hand opens the tables, and there are revealed the precepts of the decalogue, traced as with a pen of fire. The
words are so plain that all can read them. Memory is aroused,
the darkness of superstition and heresy is swept from every
mind, and God’s ten words, brief, comprehensive, and
authoritative, are presented to the view of all the inhabitants of earth. Wonderful code! wonderful occasion!
It is impossible to describe the horror and despair of
those who have trampled upon God’s holy requirements.
The Lord gave them His law; they might have compared
their characters with it, and learned their defects while yet
there was opportunity for repentance and reform; but in order to secure the favor of the world, they set aside its precepts and taught others to transgress. They have endeavored
to compel God’s people to profane His Sabbath. Now they
are condemned by that law which they have despised. With
awful distinctness they see that they are without excuse. They
chose whom they would serve and worship. “Then shall ye
return, and discern between the righteous and the wicked,
between him that serveth God and him that serveth him not.”
Malachi 3:18.
The enemies of God’s law, from the ministers down to
the least among them, have a new conception of truth
and duty. Too late they see that the Sabbath of the fourth
commandment is the seal of the living God. Too late they
see the true nature of their spurious Sabbath, and the
sandy foundation upon which they have been building.
They find that they have been fighting against God. Religious teachers have led souls to perdition while professing
to guide them to the gates of Paradise. Not until the day of
final accounts will it be known how great is the responsibil-

ity of men in holy office, and how terrible are the results of
their unfaithfulness. Only in eternity can we rightly estimate
the loss of a single soul. Fearful will be the doom of him to
whom God shall say, Depart, thou wicked servant.
The voice of God is heard from Heaven declaring the
day and hour of Jesus’ coming, and delivering the everlasting covenant to His people. Like peals of loudest thunder, His words roll through the earth. The Israel of God stand
listening, with their eyes fixed upward. Their countenances
are lighted up with His glory, and shine as did the face of
Moses when He came down from Sinai. The wicked cannot
look upon them. And when the blessing is pronounced on
those who have honored God by keeping His Sabbath
holy, there is a mighty shout of victory.
Soon there appears in the east a small black cloud,
about half the size of a man’s hand. It is the cloud which
surrounds the Saviour, and which seems in the distance to be
shrouded in darkness. The people of God know this to be
the sign of the Son of man. In solemn silence they gaze
upon it as it draws nearer the earth, becoming lighter and
more glorious, until it is a great white cloud, its base a glory
like consuming fire, and above it the rainbow of the covenant. Jesus rides forth as a mighty conqueror, and the
armies of Heaven follow Him. With songs of triumph, a
vast retinue of holy angels escort Him on His way. The
firmament seems filled with shining forms, ten thousand
times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands. No pen
can picture, no human mind conceive, the glory of the scene.
As the living cloud comes still nearer, Jesus can be clearly
seen. He does not wear a crown of thorns, but a crown of
glory rests upon His holy brow. His countenance shines as
the noonday sun. Upon His vesture and thigh is a name
written, “King of kings, and Lord of lords.”
Before Him every face turns pale, and upon those
whom God has rejected, falls the blackness of despair.
The righteous cry with trembling, “Who shall be able to
stand?” The song of the angels ceases, and there is a period
of awful silence. Then the voice of Jesus is heard, saying,

404

The

Great

Controversy

“My grace is sufficient for you.” The faces of the righteous
are lighted up, and joy fills every heart. And the angels strike
a note higher, and sing again, as they draw still nearer to the
earth.
The King of kings descends upon the cloud, wrapped
in flaming fire. The earth trembles before Him, the heavens
are rolled together as a scroll, and every mountain and every
island is moved out of its place. Says the psalmist: “Our
God shall come, and shall not keep silence; a fire shall devour before Him, and it shall be very tempestuous round
about him. He shall call to the heavens from above, and to
the earth, that He may judge His people. Gather My saints
together unto Me; those that have made a covenant with Me
by sacrifice. And the heavens shall declare His righteousness; for God is judge Himself.” Psalm 50:3-6.
“And the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the
rich men, and the chief captains, and the mighty men, and
every bondman, and every freeman, hid themselves in
the dens and in the rocks of the mountains, and said to
the mountains and rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from
the face of Him that sitteth on the throne, and from the
wrath of the Lamb; for the great day of His wrath is come,
and who shall be able to stand?” Revelation 6:15-17.
The derisive jests have ceased. Lying lips are hushed
into silence. The clash of arms, the tumult of battle, “with
confused noise, and garments rolled in blood” (Isaiah 9:5),
is stilled. Naught now is heard but the voice of prayer and
the sound of weeping and lamentation. The cry bursts forth
from lips so lately scoffing, “The great day of His wrath is
come; and who shall be able to stand?” The wicked pray to
be covered by the rocks of the mountains, rather than meet
the face of Him whom they have despised and rejected.
Those who mocked Christ in His humiliation are in
that throng. With thrilling power come to their minds the
Sufferer’s words, when, adjured by the high priest, He solemnly declared, “Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of
heaven.” Matthew 26:64. Now they behold Christ in His

God’s

People

Delivered

[641-643]

405

glory, and they are yet to see Him sitting on the right hand of
power.
That voice which penetrates the ear of the dead, they
know. How often have its plaintive, tender tones called
them to repentance. How often has it been heard in the
touching entreaties of a friend, a brother, a Redeemer. To the
rejecters of His grace, no other could be so full of condemnation, so burdened with denunciation, as that voice which
has so long pleaded, “Turn ye, turn ye; for why will ye die?”
Oh that it were to them the voice of a stranger! Says Jesus,
“I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out My hand,
and no man regarded. But ye have set at naught all My counsel, and would none of My reproof.” Proverbs 1:24, 25. That
voice awakens memories which they would fain blot out,—
warnings despised, invitations refused, privileges slighted.
Those who derided His claim to be the Son of God are
speechless now. There is the haughty Herod who jeered
at His royal title, and bade the mocking soldiers crown Him
king. There are the very men who with impious hands placed
upon His form the purple robe, upon His sacred brow the
thorny crown, and in his unresisting hand the mimic scepter,
and bowed before Him in blasphemous mockery. The men
who smote and spit upon the Prince of life, now turn from
His piercing gaze, and seek to flee from the overpowering
glory of His presence. Those who drove the nails through
His hands and feet, the soldier who pierced His side, behold
these marks with terror and remorse.
With awful distinctness do priests and rulers recall
the events of Calvary. With shuddering horror they remember how, wagging their heads in Satanic exultation, they exclaimed, “He saved others; Himself He cannot save. If He
be the King of Israel, let Him now come down from the cross,
and we will believe Him. He trusted in God; let Him deliver
Him now, if He will have Him.” Matthew 27:42, 43.
Vividly they recall the Saviour’s parable of the husbandmen who refused to render to their lord the fruit of the vineyard, who abused His servants and slew His son. They remember, too, the sentence which they themselves pronounced:

406

The

Great

Controversy

The lord of the vineyard will miserably destroy those wicked
men. In the sin and punishment of those unfaithful men, the
priests and elders see their own course and their own just
doom. And now there rises a cry of mortal agony. Louder
than the shout, “Crucify Him! crucify Him!” which rang
through the streets of Jerusalem, swells the awful, despairing wail, “He is the Son of God! He is the true Messiah!”
They seek to flee from the presence of the King of kings. In
the deep caverns of the earth, rent asunder by the warring of
the elements, they vainly attempt to hide.
In the lives of all who reject truth, there are moments
when conscience awakens, when memory presents the
torturing recollection of a life of hypocrisy, and the soul
is harassed with vain regrets. But what are these compared with the remorse of that day when “fear cometh
as desolation,” when “destruction cometh as a whirlwind!”
Proverbs 1:27. Those who would have destroyed Christ and
His faithful people, now witness the glory which rests upon
them. In the midst of their terror they hear the voices of the
saints in joyful strains exclaiming, “Lo, this is our God, we
have waited for Him, and He will save us.” Isaiah 25:9.
Amid the reeling of the earth, the flashing of lightning,
and the roaring of thunder, the voice of the Son of God
calls forth the sleeping saints. He looks upon the graves of
the righteous, then raising His hands to heaven He cries,
“Awake, awake, awake, ye that sleep in the dust, and arise!”
Throughout the length and breadth of the earth, the dead
shall hear that voice, and they that hear shall live. And the
whole earth shall ring with the tread of the exceeding great
army of every nation, kindred, tongue, and people. From the
prison-house of death they come, clothed with immortal glory,
crying, “O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy
victory?” 1 Corinthians 15:55. And the living righteous
and the risen saints unite their voices in a long, glad shout
of victory.
All come forth from their graves the same in stature
as when they entered the tomb. Adam, who stands among
the risen throng, is of lofty height and majestic form, in stat-

God’s

People

[643-646]

407

ure but little below the Son of God. He presents a marked
contrast to the people of later generations; in this one respect is shown the great degeneracy of the race. But all arise
from their last deep slumber with the freshness and vigor
of eternal youth. In the beginning, man was created in the
likeness of God, not only in character, but in form and feature. Sin defaced and almost obliterated the divine image;
but Christ came to restore that which had been lost. He will
change our vile bodies, and fashion them like unto His glorious body. The mortal, corruptible form, devoid of comeliness, once polluted with sin, becomes perfect, beautiful, and
immortal. All blemishes and deformities are left in the
grave. The redeemed bear the image of their Lord. Oh,
wonderful redemption! long talked of, long hoped for, contemplated with eager anticipation, but never fully understood.
The living righteous are changed in a moment, in the
twinkling of an eye. At the voice of God they were glorified; now they are made immortal, and with the risen
saints are caught up to meet their Lord in the air. Friends
long separated by death are united, never more to part.
Little children are borne by holy angels to their mothers’ arms, and together, with songs of gladness, they ascend to the city of God.
On each side of the cloudy chariot are wings, and beneath
it are living wheels; and as the chariot rolls upward, the wheels
cry, “Holy,” and the wings, as they move, cry, “Holy,” and
the retinue of angels cry, “Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty.” And the people of God shout “Alleluia!” as the
chariot moves onward toward the New Jerusalem.
Before entering the city, the saints are arranged in a
hollow square, with Jesus in the midst. In height He surpasses both the saints and the angels. His majestic form and
lovely countenance can be seen by all in the square. Upon
the heads of the overcomers the Saviour, with His own right
hand, places the crowns of glory. For every saint there is a
crown, bearing his new name, and the inscription, “Holiness
to the Lord.” In every hand is placed the victor’s palm and
the shining harp. The commanding angels strike the note,

408

The

Great

Controversy

and every voice is raised in grateful praise, every hand sweeps
the harp-strings with skillful touch, awaking sweet music in
rich, melodious strains.
Before the ransomed throng is the holy city. Jesus
opens wide the pearly gates, and the nations that have
kept the truth enter in. There they behold the Paradise
of God, the home of Adam in his innocency. Then that voice,
richer than any music that ever fell on mortal ear, is heard,
saying, “Your conflict is ended.” The Saviour’s countenance
beams with unutterable love as He welcomes the redeemed
to the joy of their Lord.
Suddenly there rings out upon the air an exultant cry
of adoration. The two Adams are about to meet. The Son
of God is standing with outstretched arms to receive the father of our race,—the being whom He created, who sinned
against His Maker, and for whose sin the marks of the crucifixion are borne upon the Saviour’s form. As Adam discerns
the prints of the cruel nails, he does not fall upon the bosom
of his Lord, but in humiliation casts himself at His feet, crying, “Worthy, worthy is the Lamb that was slain!” Tenderly
the Saviour lifts him up, and directs his attention to the Eden
home from which he has so long been exiled.
After his expulsion from Eden, Adam’s life on earth was
filled with sorrow. Every dying leaf, every victim of sacrifice, every blight upon the fair face of nature, every stain
upon man’s purity, was a fresh reminder of his sin. Terrible
was the agony of remorse as he beheld iniquity abounding,
and, in answer to his reproofs, met the reproaches cast upon
himself as the cause of sin. With patient humility he bore,
for nearly a thousand years, the penalty of transgression.
Faithfully did he repent of his sin, and trust in the merits of
the promised Saviour, and he died in the hope of a resurrection. The Son of God redeemed man’s failure and fall, and
now, through the work of the atonement, Adam is re-instated
in his first dominion.
Transported with joy, he beholds the trees that were once
his delight,—the very trees from which he plucked fruit when
he rejoiced in the perfection of innocence and holiness. He

God’s

People

Delivered

[646-650]

409

sees the vines that his own hands have trained, the very flowers that he once loved to care for. His mind grasps the reality
of the scene; he comprehends that this is indeed Eden restored, far more beautiful now than when he was banished
from it. The Saviour leads him to the tree of life, and plucks
the glorious fruit, and bids him eat. He looks about him, and
beholds a multitude of his family redeemed, standing in the
Paradise of God. Then he casts his glittering crown at the
feet of Jesus, and, falling upon his breast, embraces the Redeemer. He touches the golden harp, and the vaults of Heaven
echo the triumphant song, “Worthy, worthy, worthy is the
Lamb that was slain, and lives again!” The family of Adam
take up the strain, and cast their crowns at the Saviour’s feet
as they bow before Him in adoration.
This reunion is witnessed by the angels who wept at the
fall of Adam, and rejoiced when Jesus, after His resurrection, ascended to Heaven, having opened the grave for all
who should believe on His name. Now they behold the work
of redemption accomplished, and they unite their voices in
the song of praise.
The Saviour’s chosen have been educated and disciplined in the school of trial. They walked in narrow paths
on earth; they were purified in the furnace of affliction.
For Jesus’ sake they endured opposition, hatred, calumny. They followed Him through conflicts sore; they
endured self-denial and experienced bitter disappointments. By their own painful experience they learned the evil
of sin, its power, its guilt, its woe; and they look upon it with
abhorrence. A sense of the infinite sacrifice made for its cure,
humbles them in their own sight, and fills their hearts with
gratitude and praise which those who have never fallen cannot appreciate. They love much, because they have been forgiven much. Having been partakers of Christ’s sufferings,
they are fitted to be partakers with Him of His glory.
The heirs of God have come from garrets, from hovels, from dungeons, from scaffolds, from mountains, from
deserts, from the caves of the earth, from the caverns of
the sea. But they are no longer feeble, afflicted, scattered,

410

The

Great

Controversy

and oppressed. Henceforth they are to be ever with the Lord.
They stand before the throne clad in richer robes than the
most honored of the earth have ever worn. They are crowned
with diadems more glorious than were ever placed upon
the brow of earthly monarchs. The days of pain and
weeping are forever ended. The King of glory has wiped
the tears from all faces; every cause of grief has been removed. Amid the waving of palm-branches they pour forth
a song of praise, clear, sweet, and harmonious; every voice
takes up the strain, until the anthem swells through the vaults
of Heaven, “Salvation to our God which sitteth upon the
throne, and unto the Lamb.” And all the inhabitants of Heaven
respond in the ascription, “Amen; blessing, and glory, and
wisdom, and thanksgiving, and honor, and power, and might,
be unto our God forever and ever.” Revelation 7:10, 12.
The theme of redemption has but just begun to be understood. With our finite comprehension we may consider most
earnestly the shame and the glory, the life and the death, the
justice and the mercy, that meet in the cross; yet with the
utmost stretch of our mental powers we fail to grasp its full
significance. The length and the breadth, the depth and the
height of redeeming love are but dimly comprehended. The
plan of redemption will not be fully understood, even
when the ransomed see as they are seen and know as
they are known; but through the eternal ages, new truth
will continually unfold to the wondering and delighted
mind. Though the griefs and pains and temptations of
earth are ended, and the cause removed, the people of
God will ever have a distinct, intelligent knowledge of
what their salvation has cost.
The cross of Christ will be the science and the song of
the redeemed through all eternity. In Christ glorified they
will behold Christ crucified. Never will it be forgotten that
He who could command all the powers of nature, who by a
word could summon mighty angels to do His will and execute vengeance upon His enemies,—the beloved of God,
the Majesty of Heaven,—submitted to insult, torture, and
death, that sinners might be redeemed. That the Maker of all

God’s

People

Delivered

[650-652]

411

worlds, the Arbiter of all destinies, should lay aside His glory,
and humiliate Himself from love to man, will ever excite the
wonder and admiration of the universe. As the nations of
the saved look upon their Redeemer, and behold the eternal glory of the Father shining in His countenance; as
they behold His throne, which is from everlasting to everlasting, and know that His kingdom is to have no end,
they break forth in rapturous song, “Worthy, worthy is
the Lamb that was slain, and hath redeemed us to God by
His own most precious blood!”
The mystery of the cross explains all other mysteries.
In the light that streams from Calvary, the attributes of
God which had filled us with fear and awe appear beautiful and attractive. Mercy, tenderness, and parental love
are seen to blend with holiness, justice, and power. While we
behold the majesty of His throne, high and lifted up, we see
His character in its gracious manifestations, and comprehend, as never before, the significance of that endearing title,
our Father.
It will be seen that He who is infinite in wisdom could
devise no plan for our salvation except the sacrifice of
His Son. The compensation for this sacrifice is the joy of
peopling the earth with ransomed beings, holy, happy,
and immortal. The result of the Saviour’s conflict with the
powers of darkness is joy to the redeemed, redounding to the
glory of God, throughout eternity. And such is the value of
the soul that the Father is satisfied with the price paid;
and Christ Himself, beholding the fruits of His great sacrifice, is satisfied.

This world is tottering, ready to fall,—and what will come

after? This chapter is a penetrating analysis of the millennium
that time not far off when time shall stand still,—when Satan will be
bound and there will be a time of reckoning —
View that time when a great controversy is nearing its end.
A time to think. Here is the truth about the millennium —

———————————————————————

“Therefore shall her plagues come in one day, death, and mourn
ing, and famine; and she shall be utterly burned with fire; for strong
is the Lord God who judgeth her. And the kings of the earth, who
have committed fornication and lived deliciously with her, shall
bewail her, and lament for her, when they shall see the smoke of her
burning, standing afar off for the fear of her torment, saying, Alas,
alas, that great city Babylon, that mighty city! for in one hour
is thy judgment come. And the merchants of the earth shall weep
and mourn over her; for no man buyeth their merchandise any more.”
Revelation 18:8-11. Such are the judgments that fall upon
Babylon in the day of the visitation of God’s wrath. She has
filled up the measure of her iniquity; her time has come; she is
ripe for destruction.
When the voice of God turns the captivity of His people,
there is a terrible awakening of those who have lost all in
the great game of life. While probation continued, they were
blinded by Satan’s deceptions, and they justified their course
of sin. The rich prided themselves upon their superiority to
those who were less favored; but they had obtained their
riches by violation of the law of God. They had neglected to
feed the hungry, to clothe the naked, to deal justly, and to

Desolation

of

the

Earth

[653-655]

413

love mercy. They had sought to exalt themselves, and to obtain the homage of their fellow-creatures. Now they are
stripped of all that made them great, and are left destitute
and defenseless. They look upon the destruction of the idols
which they preferred before their Maker. They sold their souls
for earthly riches and enjoyments, and did not seek to become rich toward God. The result is, their lives are a failure; their pleasures are now turned to gall, their treasures to corruption. The gain of a lifetime is swept away
in a moment. The rich bemoan the destruction of their grand
houses, the scattering of their gold and silver. But their lamentations are silenced by the fear that they themselves are to
perish with their idols.
The wicked are filled with regret, not because of their
sinful neglect of God and their fellow-men, but because
God has conquered. They lament that the result is what it
is; but they do not repent of their wickedness. They would
leave no means untried to conquer if they could.
The world see the very class whom they have mocked
and derided, and desired to exterminate, pass unharmed
through tempest and earthquake and pestilence. He who
is to the transgressors of His law a devouring fire, is to His
people a safe pavilion.
The minister who has sacrificed truth to gain the favor of men, now discerns the character and influence of
his teachings. It is apparent that an omniscient eye was following him as he stood in the desk, as he walked the streets,
as he mingled with men in the various scenes of life. Every
emotion of the soul, every line written, every word uttered,
every act that led men to rest in a refuge of falsehood, has
been scattering seed; and now, in the wretched, lost souls
around him, he beholds the harvest.
Ministers and people see that they have not sustained
the right relation to God. They see that they have rebelled against the Author of all just and righteous law.
The setting aside of the divine precepts gave rise to thousands of springs of evil, discord, hatred, iniquity, until the
earth became one vast field of strife, one sink of corruption.

414

The

Great

Controversy

This is the view that now appears to those who rejected truth
and chose to cherish error. No language can express the longing which the disobedient and disloyal feel for that which
they have lost forever,—eternal life. Men whom the world
has worshiped for their talents and eloquence now see these
things in their true light. They realize what they have forfeited by transgression, and they fall at the feet of those
whose fidelity they have despised and derided, and confess that God has loved them.
The people see that they have been deluded. They eagerly accuse one another of having led them to destruction;
but all unite in heaping their bitterest condemnation upon
the ministers. Unfaithful pastors have prophesied smooth
things; they have led their hearers to make void the law
of God and to persecute those who would keep it holy.
Now, in their despair, these teachers confess before the world
their work of deception. The multitudes are filled with fury.
“We are lost!” they cry, “and you are the cause of our ruin;”
and they turn upon the false watchmen. The very ones that
once admired them most, will pronounce the most dreadful
curses upon them. The very hands that once crowned them
with laurels will be raised for their destruction. The swords
which were to slay God’s people are now employed to destroy their enemies. Everywhere there is strife and bloodshed.
The mark of deliverance has been set upon those “that
sigh and that cry for all the abominations that be done.” Now
the angel of death goes forth, represented in Ezekiel’s vision
by the men with the slaughtering weapons, to whom the command is given: “Slay utterly old and young, both maids, and
little children, and women; but come not near any man upon
whom is the mark; and begin at my sanctuary.” Says the
prophet, “They began at the ancient men which were before
the house.” Ezekiel 9:6. The work of destruction begins
among those who profess to be the spiritual guardians of the
people. The false shepherds are the first to fall. There are
none to pity or to spare. Men, women, maidens, and little

children perish together.
“The Lord cometh out of His place to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity; the earth also shall
disclose her blood, and shall no more cover her slain.” Isaiah
26:21. “And this shall be the plague wherewith the Lord will
smite all the people that fought against Jerusalem: Their flesh
shall consume away while they stand upon their feet, and
their eyes shall consume away in their holes, and their tongue
shall consume away in their mouth. And it shall come to
pass in that day that a great tumult from the Lord shall be
among them; and they shall lay hold every one on the hand
of his neighbor, and his hand shall rise up against the hand
of his neighbor.” Zechariah 14:12, 13. In the mad strife of
their own fierce passions, and by the awful outpouring
of God’s unmingled wrath, fall the wicked inhabitants of
the earth,—priests, rulers, and people, rich and poor, high
and low. “And the slain of the Lord shall be at that day from
one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth;
they shall not be lamented, neither gathered, nor buried.”
Jeremiah 25:33.
At the coming of Christ the wicked are blotted from
the face of the whole earth,—consumed with the spirit of
His mouth, and destroyed by the brightness of His glory.
Christ takes His people to the city of God, and the earth
is emptied of its inhabitants. “Behold, the Lord maketh the
earth empty, and maketh it waste, and turneth it upside down,
and scattereth abroad the inhabitants thereof. “The land shall
be utterly emptied, and utterly spoiled; for the Lord hath spoken this word.” “Because they have transgressed the laws,
changed the ordinance, broken the everlasting covenant.
Therefore hath the curse devoured the earth, and they that
dwell therein are desolate; therefore the inhabitants of the
earth are burned.” Isaiah 24:1, 3, 5, 6.
The whole earth appears like a desolate wilderness.

CHAPTER SUPPLEMENT
SUPPLEMENT:: THE BIBLICAL MILLENNIUM

We live in the last days of history. The end of life as men now know it is
nearly ended. Soon Jesus will return. We only have one period of probation—
and that is during our present life. The millennium will not be a thousand years
of glory and peace here on earth. And it will not be an age of technological
progress or a “second chance” for the wicked. All mankind will not be converted before it, during it, or after it. And neither Christ nor His redeemed ones
will be on the earth during the thousand years.
Here is the truth about the millennium and the events that mark its beginning and end:
1 - Jesus is going to return for His people: He promised us that He would
(John 14:1-3), and so we can know that He will.
2 - There are four identifying marks of His second advent that cannot be
counterfeited by false christs: (1) He will come so that all alive on the earth at
that time can see Him return (Rev 1:7; Acts 1:9-11; Matt 24:30, 23-27). (2) He
will come so all can hear Him as He returns (Matt 24:31; 1 Thess 4:16). (3) He
will come in immense glory—that of His own and the millions of angels that
will come with Him (Lk 9:26; Matt 28:2-4; Matt 25:31; Rev 6:14-17). (4) He
will come unexpectedly (Matt 24:44, 36).
3 - His second coming will mark the beginning of the millennium. Six events
will take place: (1) He will raise the righteous dead (1 Thess 4:16). (2) He will
catch up the righteous living together with the righteous dead—to meet Him in
the clouds (1 Thess 4:17). (3) He will change their vile bodies to be like unto
His glorious body (Phil 3:20-21) and translate them (1 Cor 15:51-55; Isa 25:9).
(4) Having gathered all the righteous (1 Thess 4:17-18; Matt 25:34-40; 24:3031), He will take His redeemed ones to heaven (Jn 14:1-3; 17:24; 1 Thess
4:16-18). (5) He will destroy the living wicked with the brightness of His coming (Lk 17:26-30; 2 Thess 2:8). (6) He will bind Satan to this earth (Rev 20:23).
4 - During the millennium, the earth will be desolate (Rev 20:3; Jer 4:2326; Isa 24:1, 3). The wicked are dead (2 Thess 2:8), and there is no man left
(Isa 24:20-22; Jer 4:25-26; 25:31-33). Satan is bound on a desolate earth
(Rev 20:1-3), and the righteous are in heaven (Rev 20:4, 6; Dan 7:22) engaged
in a work of judgment (Rev 20:4; 1 Cor 6:1-3; Acts 24:25; Jude 6).
5 - At the close of the millennium, the Holy City descends from heaven
(Rev 20:9; 21:1-5; Zech 14: 4, 9), the wicked are raised—the “second resurrection” (Rev 20:5, first part), and Satan is thus loosed to deceive them again
(Rev 20:7-8). Satan and the wicked surround the City to take it (Rev 20:8-9. All
of the wicked are destroyed (Rev 20:9), and this earth is made new (Rev 21:15; 2 Pet 3:10-14). How we long for the second coming of Christ!

sea or torn out of the earth itself, are scattered over its
surface, while vast caverns mark the spot where the mountains have been rent from their foundations. Here is to be
the home of Satan with his evil angels for a thousand
years. Here he will be confined, to wander up and down
over the broken surface of the earth, and see the effects
of his rebellion against the law of God. For a thousand
years he can enjoy the fruit of the curse which he has caused.
Limited alone to the earth, he will not have the privilege of
ranging to other planets, to tempt and annoy those who have
not fallen. During this time, Satan suffers extremely. Since
his fall his life of intense activity has banished reflection;
but he is now deprived of his power, and left to contemplate the part which he has acted since first he rebelled
against the government of Heaven, and to look forward
with trembling and terror to the dreadful future, when
he must suffer for all the evil that he has done, and be punished for the sins that he has caused to be committed.
Shouts of triumph ascend from the angels and the redeemed saints, that they are to be no more annoyed and
tempted by Satan, and that the inhabitants of other worlds
are delivered from his presence and temptations.
During the thousand years between the first and the
second resurrection, the Judgment of the wicked dead
takes place. The righteous reign as kings and priests unto
God; and in union with Christ they judge the wicked,
comparing their acts with the statute book, the Bible,
and deciding every case according to the deeds done in
the body. Then the portion which the wicked must suffer is
meted out, according to their works; and it is written against
their names in the book of death. Satan also and evil angels
are judged by Christ and His people.
“We, according to HIs promise, look for new heavens and a new earth,
wherein dwelleth righteousness . . seeing that ye look for such things, be
diligent.” 2 Peter 3:13-14.

At the close of the thousand years, Christ again returns to the earth. He is accompanied by the host of the
redeemed, and attended by a retinue of angels. As He
descends in terrific majesty, He bids the wicked dead
arise to receive their doom. They come forth, a mighty
host, numberless as the sands of the sea. What a contrast to
those who were raised at the first resurrection! The righteous
were clothed with immortal youth and beauty. The wicked
bear the traces of disease and death.
Every eye in that vast multitude is turned to behold
the glory of the Son of God. With one voice the wicked
hosts exclaim, “Blessed is He that cometh in the name of the
Lord!” It is not love to Jesus that inspires this utterance. The
force of truth urges the words from unwilling lips. As the

420

The

Great

Controversy

wicked went into their graves, so they come forth, with
the same enmity to Christ and the same spirit of rebellion. They are to have no new probation, in which to remedy the defects of their past lives. Nothing would be
gained by this. A lifetime of transgression has not softened
their hearts. A second probation, were it given them, would
be occupied as was the first, in evading the requirements of
God and exciting rebellion against Him.
Christ descends upon the Mount of Olives, and as His
feet touch the mountain, it parts asunder, and becomes a
vast plain. Then the New Jerusalem, in its dazzling splendor, comes down out of Heaven. As it rests upon the place
purified and made ready to receive it, Christ, with His
people and the angels, enters the holy city.
Now Satan prepares for a last mighty struggle for the
supremacy. While deprived of his power, and cut off from
his work of deception, the prince of evil was miserable and
dejected; but as the wicked dead are raised, and he sees the
vast multitudes upon his side, his hopes revive, and he determines not to yield the great controversy. He will marshal
all the armies of the lost under his banner, and through them
endeavor to execute his plans. The wicked are Satan’s captives. In rejecting Christ they have accepted the rule of the
rebel leader. They are ready to receive his suggestions and to
do his bidding. Yet, true to his early cunning, he does not
acknowledge himself to be Satan. He claims to be the
Prince who is the rightful owner of the world, and whose
inheritance has been unlawfully wrested from him. He
represents himself to his deluded subjects as a redeemer, assuring them that his power has brought them forth from their
graves, and that he is about to rescue them from the most
cruel tyranny. The presence of Christ having been removed,
Satan works wonders to support his claims. He makes the
weak strong, and inspires all with his own spirit and energy. He proposes to lead them against the camp of the
saints, and to take possession of the city of God. With
fiendish exultation he points to the unnumbered millions who
have been raised from the dead, and declares that as their

The

Controversy

Ended

[662-664]

421

leader he is well able to overthrow the city, and regain his
throne and his kingdom.
In that vast throng are multitudes of the long-lived
race that existed before the flood; men of lofty stature
and giant intellect, who, yielding to the control of fallen
angels, devoted all their skill and knowledge to the exaltation of themselves; men whose wonderful works of art led
the world to idolize their genius, but whose cruelty and evil
inventions, defiling the earth and defacing the image of God,
caused him to blot them from the face of His creation. There
are kings and generals who conquered nations, valiant
men who never lost a battle, proud, ambitious warriors
whose approach made kingdoms tremble. In death these
experienced no change. As they come up from the grave,
they resume the current of their thoughts just where it
ceased. They are actuated by the same desire to conquer
that ruled them when they fell.
Satan consults with his angels, and then with these
kings and conquerors and mighty men. They look upon
the strength and numbers upon their side, and declare
that the army within the city is small in comparison with
theirs, and that it can be overcome. They lay their plans
to take possession of the riches and glory of the New
Jerusalem. All immediately begin to prepare for battle. Skillful artisans construct implements of war. Military leaders,
famed for their success, marshal the throngs of warlike men
into companies and divisions.
At last the order to advance is given, and the countless host moves on,—an army such as was never summoned by earthly conquerors, such as the combined
forces of all ages since war began could never equal. Satan, the mightiest of warriors, leads the van, and his angels
join their forces for this final struggle. Kings and warriors
are in his train, and the multitudes follow in vast companies,
each army under its appointed leader. With military precision, the serried ranks advance over the earth’s broken
and uneven surface to the city of God. By the command
of Jesus, the gates of the New Jerusalem are closed, and

422

The

Great

Controversy

the armies of Satan surround the city, and make ready
for the onset.
Now Christ again appears to the view of His enemies.
Far above the city, upon a foundation of burnished gold,
is a throne, high and lifted up. Upon this throne sits the
Son of God, and around Him are the subjects of His kingdom. The power and majesty of Christ no language can describe, no pen portray. The glory of the Eternal Father is
enshrouding His Son. The brightness of His presence fills
the city of God, and flows out beyond the gates, flooding the
whole earth with its radiance.
Nearest the throne are those who were once zealous in the
cause of Satan, but who, plucked as brands from the burning, have followed their Saviour with deep, intense devotion. Next are those who perfected Christian characters in
the midst of falsehood and infidelity, those who honored the
law of God when the Christian world declared it void, and
the millions, of all ages, who were martyred for their faith.
And beyond is the “great multitude which no man could number, of all nations and kindreds and people and tongues,”
“before the throne and before the Lamb, clothed with white
robes, and palms in their hands.” Their warfare is ended,
their victory won. They have run the race and reached the
prize. The palm branch in their hands is a symbol of their
triumph, the white robe an emblem of the spotless righteousness of Christ which now is theirs.
The redeemed raise a song of praise that echoes and
re-echoes through the vaults of Heaven, “Salvation to our
God which sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb.” And
angel and seraph unite their voices in adoration. As the redeemed have beheld the power and malignity of Satan,
they have seen, as never before, that no power but that
of Christ could have made them conquerors. In all that
shining throng there are none to ascribe salvation to
themselves, as if they had prevailed by their own power and
goodness. Nothing is said of what they have done or suffered; but the burden of every song, the keynote of every
anthem, is, Salvation to our God and unto the Lamb.

In the presence of the assembled inhabitants of earth
and Heaven takes place the final coronation of the Son
of God. And now, invested with supreme majesty and
power, the King of kings pronounces sentence upon the
rebels against His government, and executes justice upon
those who have transgressed His law and oppressed His
people. Says the prophet of God: “I saw a great white throne,
and Him that sat on it, from whose face the earth and the
heaven fled away; and there was found no place for them.
And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and
the books were opened; and another book was opened, which
is the book of life; and the dead were judged out of those
things which were written in the books, according to their
works.” Revelation 20:11, 12.
As soon as the books of record are opened, and the
eye of Jesus looks upon the wicked, they are conscious of
every sin which they have ever committed. They see just
where their feet diverged from the path of purity and
holiness, just how far pride and rebellion have carried them
in the violation of the law of God. The seductive temptations which they encouraged by indulgence in sin, the blessings perverted, the messengers of God despised, the warnings rejected, the waves of mercy beaten back by the stubborn, unrepentant heart,—all appear as if written in letters
of fire.
Above the throne is revealed the cross; and like a panoramic view appear the scenes of Adam’s temptation and
fall, and the successive steps in the great plan of redemption. The Saviour’s lowly birth; His early life of simplicity
and obedience; His baptism in Jordan; the fast and temptation in the wilderness; his public ministry, unfolding to men
Heaven’s most precious blessings; the days crowded with
deeds of love and mercy, the nights of prayer and watching
in the solitude of the mountains; the plottings of envy, hate,
and malice which repaid His benefits; the awful, mysterious
agony in Gethsemane, beneath the crushing weight of the
sins of the whole world; His betrayal into the hands of the
murderous mob; the fearful events of that night of horror,—

424

The

Controversy

the unresisting prisoner, forsaken by His best-loved disciples,
rudely hurried through the streets of Jerusalem; the Son of
God exultingly displayed before Annas, arraigned in the high
priest’s palace, in the judgment hall of Pilate, before the cowardly and cruel Herod, mocked, insulted, tortured, and condemned to die,—all are vividly portrayed.
And now before the swaying multitude are revealed
the final scenes,—the patient Sufferer treading the path
to Calvary; the Prince of Heaven hanging upon the cross;
the haughty priests and the jeering rabble deriding his expiring agony; the supernatural darkness; the heaving earth, the
rent rocks, the open graves, marking the moment when the
world’s Redeemer yielded up His life.
The awful spectacle appears just as it was. Satan, his
angels, and his subjects have no power to turn from the
picture of their own work. Each actor recalls the part
which he performed. Herod, who slew the innocent children of Bethlehem that he might destroy the King of Israel;
the base Herodias, upon whose guilty soul rests the blood of
John the Baptist; the weak, time-serving Pilate; the mocking
soldiers; the priests and rulers and the maddened throng who
cried, “His blood be on us, and our children!”—all behold
the enormity of their guilt. They vainly seek to hide from
the divine majesty of His countenance, outshining the
glory of the sun, while the redeemed cast their crowns at
the Saviour’s feet, exclaiming, “He died for me!”
Amid the ransomed throng are the apostles of Christ, the
heroic Paul, the ardent Peter, the loved and loving John, and
their true-hearted brethren, and with them the vast host of
martyrs; while outside the walls, with every vile and abominable thing, are those by whom they were persecuted, imprisoned, and slain. There is Nero, that monster of cruelty
and vice, beholding the joy and exaltation of those whom he
once tortured, and in whose extremest anguish he found Satanic delight. His mother is there to witness the result of her
own work; to see how the evil stamp of character transmitted to her son, the passions encouraged and developed by
her influence and example, have borne fruit in crimes that

The

Controversy

Ended

[667-669]

425

caused the world to shudder.
There are papist priests and prelates, who claimed to
be Christ’s ambassadors, yet employed the rack, the dungeon, and the stake to control the consciences of His people.
There are the proud pontiffs who exalted themselves above
God, and presumed to change the law of the Most High.
Those pretended fathers of the church have an account to
render to God from which they would fain be excused. Too
late they are made to see that the Omniscient One is jealous
of His law, and that He will in no wise clear the guilty. They
learn now that Christ identifies His interest with that of His
suffering people; and they feel the force of His own words,
“Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these
my brethren, ye have done it unto me.”
The whole wicked world stand arraigned at the bar
of God, on the charge of high treason against the government of Heaven. They have none to plead their cause;
they are without excuse; and the sentence of eternal death
is pronounced against them.
It is now evident to all that the wages of sin is not
noble independence and eternal life, but slavery, ruin,
and death. The wicked see what they have forfeited by their
life of rebellion. The far more exceeding and eternal weight
of glory was despised when offered them; but how desirable
it now appears. “All this,” cries the lost soul, “I might have
had; but I chose to put these things far from me. Oh, strange
infatuation! I have exchanged peace, happiness, and honor,
for wretchedness, infamy, and despair.” All see that their exclusion from Heaven is just. In their lives they declared, We
will not have this Jesus to reign over us.
As if entranced, the wicked have looked upon the coronation of the Son of God. They see in His hands the tables
of the divine law, the statutes which they have despised
and transgressed. They witness the outburst of wonder,
rapture, and adoration from the saved; and as the wave of
melody sweeps over the multitudes without the city, all
with one voice exclaim, “Marvelous are Thy works, Lord
God Almighty; just and true are thy ways, thou King of

426

The

Great

Controversy

saints;” and falling prostrate, they worship the Prince
of life.
Satan seems paralyzed as he beholds the glory and
majesty of Christ. He who was once a covering cherub
remembers whence he has fallen. A shining seraph, “son
of the morning;” how changed, how degraded! From the council where once he was honored, he is forever excluded. He
sees another now standing near to the Father, veiling His
glory. He has seen the crown placed upon the head of Christ
by an angel of lofty stature and majestic presence, and he
knows that this office might have been his.
Memory recalls the home of his innocence and purity,
the peace and content that were his until he indulged in
murmuring against God, and envy of Christ. His accusations, his rebellion, his deceptions to gain the sympathy and
support of the angels, his stubborn persistence in making no
effort for self-recovery when God would have granted him
forgiveness,—all come vividly before him. He reviews his
work among men and its results,—the enmity of man toward his fellow-man, the terrible destruction of life, the rise
and fall of kingdoms, the overturning of thrones, the long
succession of tumults, conflicts, and revolutions. He recalls
his constant efforts to oppose the work of Christ and to sink
man lower and lower. He sees that his hellish plots have been
powerless to destroy those who have put their trust in Jesus.
As Satan looks upon His kingdom, the fruit of His toil,
He sees only failure and ruin. He has led the multitudes
to believe that the city of God would be an easy prey;
but he knows that this is false. Again and again in the
progress of the great controversy has he been defeated
and compelled to yield. He knows too well the power and
majesty of the Eternal.
The aim of the great rebel has ever been to justify himself, and to prove the divine government responsible for
the rebellion. To this end he has bent all the power of his
giant intellect. He has worked deliberately and systematically, and with marvelous success, leading vast multitudes
to accept his version of the great controversy which has been

The

Controversy

Ended

[669-671]

427

so long in progress. For thousands of years this chief of
conspiracy has palmed off falsehood for truth. But the
time has now come when the rebellion is to be finally
defeated, and the history and character of Satan disclosed. In his last great effort to dethrone Christ, destroy
His people, and take possession of the city of God, the
arch-deceiver has been fully unmasked. Those who have
united with him see the total failure of his cause. Christ’s
followers and the loyal angels behold the full extent of his
machinations against the government of God. He is the object of universal abhorrence.
Satan sees that his voluntary rebellion has unfitted
him for Heaven. He has trained his powers to war against
God; the purity, peace, and harmony of Heaven would be to
him supreme torture. His accusations against the mercy and
justice of God are now silenced. The reproach which he has
endeavored to cast upon Jehovah rests wholly upon himself.
And now Satan bows down, and confesses the justice of his
sentence.
Every question of truth and error in the long-standing controversy is made plain. God’s justice stands fully
vindicated. Before the whole world is clearly presented
the great sacrifice made by the Father and the Son in
man’s behalf. The hour has come when Christ occupies His
rightful position, and is glorified above principalities and
powers and every name that is named.
It was for the joy that was set before Him,—that He
might bring many sons unto glory,—that he endured the
cross and despised the shame. And inconceivably great
as was the sorrow and the shame, so great is the joy and
the glory. He looks upon the redeemed, renewed in His own
image, every face reflecting the likeness of their King. In
their perfect purity and surpassing joy He beholds the result
of the travail of His soul, and He is satisfied. Then, in a
voice that reaches the assembled multitudes of the righteous and the wicked, He declares, “Behold the purchase
of My blood! For these I suffered; for these I died; that
they might dwell in My presence throughout eternal

428

The

Great

Controversy

ages.” And the song of praise ascends from the whiterobed ones about the throne, “Worthy is the Lamb that
was slain to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and
strength, and honor, and glory, and blessing.”
Notwithstanding Satan has been constrained to acknowledge God’s justice, and to bow to the supremacy
of Christ, his character remains unchanged. The spirit
of rebellion, like a mighty torrent, again bursts forth.
Filled with frenzy, he determines not to yield the great controversy. The time has come for a last desperate struggle
against the King of Heaven. He rushes into the midst of
his subjects, and endeavors to inspire them with his own
fury, and arouse them to instant battle. But of all the
countless millions whom he has allured into rebellion,
there are none now to acknowledge his supremacy. His
power is at an end. The wicked are filled with the same
hatred of God that inspires Satan; but they see that their case
is hopeless, that they cannot prevail against Jehovah. Their
rage is kindled against Satan and those who have been his
agents in deception. With the fury of demons they turn upon
them, and there follows a scene of universal strife.
Then are fulfilled the words of the prophet: “The indignation of the Lord is upon all nations, and His fury upon all
their armies: He hath utterly destroyed them, He hath delivered them to the slaughter.” Isaiah 34:2. “Upon the wicked
He shall rain quick burning coals, fire and brimstone,
and an horrible tempest: this shall be the portion of their
cup.” Psalm 11:6 [margin]. Fire comes down from God
out of heaven. The earth is broken up. The weapons concealed in its depths are drawn forth. Devouring flames burst
from every yawning chasm. The very rocks are on fire. The
day has come that shall burn as an oven. Malachi 4:1. The
elements melt with fervent heat, the earth also, and the works
that are therein are burned up. 2 Peter 3:10. The fire of Tophet
is “prepared for the king,” the chief of rebellion; the pile
thereof is deep and large, and “the breath of the Lord, like a
stream of brimstone, doth kindle it.” Isaiah 30:33. The
earth’s surface seems one molten mass,—a vast, seeth-

Ended

[671-674]

ing lake of fire. It is the time of the judgment and perdition of ungodly men,—“the day of the Lord’s vengeance,
and the year of recompenses for the controversy of Zion.”
Isaiah 34:8.
The wicked receive their recompense in the earth. They
“shall be stubble; and the day that cometh shall burn
them up, saith the Lord of hosts.” Some are destroyed
as in a moment, while others suffer many days. All are
punished according to their deeds. The sins of the righteous have been transferred to Satan, the originator of evil,
who must bear their penalty. Thus he is made to suffer not
only for his own rebellion, but for all the sins which he has
caused God’s people to commit. His punishment is to be far
greater than that of those whom he has deceived. After all
have perished who fell by his deceptions, he is still to live
and suffer on. In the cleansing flames the wicked are at
last destroyed, root and branch,—Satan the root, his followers the branches. The justice of God is satisfied, and
the saints and all the angelic host say with a loud voice, Amen.
While the earth is wrapped in the fire of God’s vengeance, the righteous abide safely in the holy city. Upon
those that had part in the first resurrection, the second death
has no power. Revelation 20:6. While God is to the wicked
a consuming fire, He is to His people both a sun and a
shield. Psalm 84:11.
“And I saw a new heaven and a new earth; for the first
heaven and the first earth were passed away.” Revelation
21:1. The fire that consumes the wicked purifies the earth.
Every trace of the curse is swept away. No eternally burning hell will keep before the ransomed the fearful consequences of sin. One reminder alone remains: our Redeemer will ever bear the marks of His crucifixion. Upon
His wounded head, His hands and feet, are the only traces of
the cruel work that sin has wrought.
“O Tower of the flock, the stronghold of the daughter of
Zion, to thee shall it come, even the first dominion.” Micah
4:8. The kingdom forfeited by sin, Christ has regained, and
the redeemed are to possess it with Him. “The righteous shall

430

The

Great

Controversy

inherit the land, and dwell therein forever.” Psalm 37:29. A
fear of making the saints’ inheritance seem too material
has led many to spiritualize away the very truths which
lead us to look upon the new earth as our home. Christ
assured His disciples that He went to prepare mansions for
them. Those who accept the teachings of God’s word will
not be wholly ignorant concerning the heavenly abode. And
yet the apostle Paul declares: “Eye hath not seen, nor ear
heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things
which God hath prepared for them that love Him.” 1
Corinthians 2:9. Human language is inadequate to describe the reward of the righteous. It will be known only
to those who behold it. No finite mind can comprehend
the glory of the Paradise of God.
In the Bible the inheritance of the saved is called a
country. Hebrews 11:14-16. There the great Shepherd leads
His flock to fountains of living waters. The tree of life yields
its fruit every month, and the leaves of the tree are for the
service of the nations. There are everflowing streams, clear
as crystal, and beside them waving trees cast their shadows
upon the paths prepared for the ransomed of the Lord. There
the wide-spreading plains swell into hills of beauty, and
the mountains of God rear their lofty summits. On those
peaceful plains, beside those living streams, God’s people,
so long pilgrims and wanderers, shall find a home.
There is the New Jerusalem, “having the glory of God,”
her light “like unto a stone most precious, even like a jasper
stone, clear as crystal.” Revelation 21:11. Saith the Lord, “I
will rejoice in Jerusalem, and joy in My people.” Isaiah 65:19.
“The tabernacle of God is with men, and He will dwell with
them, and they shall be His people, and God Himself shall
be with them, and be their God, And God shall wipe away
all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death,
neither sorrow nor crying, neither shall there be any more
pain; for the former things are passed away.” Revelation 21:3,
4.
In the city of God “there shall be no night.” None will
need or desire repose. There will be no weariness in do-

The

Controversy

Ended

[674-678]

431

ing the will of God and offering praise to His name. We
shall ever feel the freshness of the morning, and shall
ever be far from its close. “And they need no candle, neither light of the sun; for the Lord God giveth them light.”
Revelation 22:5. The light of the sun will be superseded by a
radiance which is not painfully dazzling, yet which immeasurably surpasses the brightness of our noontide. The glory
of God and the Lamb floods the holy city with unfading light.
The redeemed walk in the sunless glory of perpetual day.
“I saw no temple therein; for the Lord God Almighty and
the Lamb are the temple of it.” Revelation 21:22. The people
of God are privileged to hold open communion with the Father and the Son. Now we “see through a glass, darkly.” 1
Corinthians 13:12. We behold the image of God reflected,
as in a mirror, in the works of nature and in His dealings
with men; but then we shall see Him face to face, without a
dimming vail between. We shall stand in His presence, and
gaze upon the glory of His countenance.
There, immortal minds will study with never-failing
delight the wonders of creative power, the mysteries of
redeeming love. There is no cruel, deceiving foe to tempt to
forgetfulness of God. Every faculty will be developed, every
capacity increased. The acquirement of knowledge will not
weary the mind or exhaust the energies. There the grandest
enterprises may be carried forward, the loftiest aspirations reached, the highest ambitions realized; and still
there will arise new heights to surmount, new wonders to
admire, new truths to comprehend, fresh objects to call forth
the powers of mind and soul and body.
And as the years of eternity roll, they will bring richer
and more glorious revelations of God and of Christ. As
knowledge is progressive, so will love, reverence, and happiness increase. The more men learn of God, the greater will
be their admiration of His character. As Jesus opens before
them the riches of redemption, and the amazing achievements
in the great controversy with Satan, the hearts of the ransomed beat with a stronger devotion, and they sweep the
harps of gold with a firmer hand; and ten thousand times ten

432

The

Great

Controversy

thousand and thousands of thousands of voices unite to swell
the mighty chorus of praise.
“And every creature which is in Heaven, and on the
earth, and under the earth, and such as are in the sea,
and all that are in them, heard I saying, Blessing, and
honor, and glory, and power, be unto Him that sitteth
upon the throne and unto the Lamb forever and ever.”
Sin and sinners are no more; God’s entire universe is
clean; and the great controversy is forever ended.
CHAPTER SUPPLEMENT
SUPPLEMENT:: LIVING FOREVER WITH CHRIST

“For the Lord God is a sun and shield: the Lord will give grace and
glory: no good thing will He withhold from them that walk uprightly.”
Psalm 84:11.
“Blessed is the man that endureth temptation: for when he is tried
he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to
them that love Him.” James 1:12.
“But the meek shall inherit the earth; and shall delight themselves
in the abundance of peace.” Psalm 37:11 (Isa 35:10; Dan 7:18).
“And this is the record, that God hath given us eternal life, and this
life is in His Son.” 1 John 5:11 (Psalm 72:8).
“Wait on the Lord, and keep His way, and He shalt exalt thee to
inherit the land: when the wicked are cut off, thou shalt see it.” Psalm
37:34.
“Neverthless we, according to His promise, look for new heavens
and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.” 2 Peter 3:13 (Isa
14:7).
“Blessed are they that do His commandments, that they may have
right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the
city.” Revelation 22:14.
“For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make,
shall remain before Me, saith the Lord, so shall your seed and your
name remain. And it shall come to pass, that from one new moon to
another, and from one Sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to
worship before Me, saith the Lord.” Isaiah 66:22-23.

Amazing Grace
Amazing grace! how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me!
I once was lost, but now am found;
Was blind, but now I see.
‘Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,
And grace my fears relieved;
How precious did that grace appear,
The hour I first believed!
Through many dangers, toils, and snares,
I have already come;
‘Tis grace hath brought me safe thus far,
And grace will lead me home.
The Lord has promised good to me,
His Word my hope secures;
He will my shield and portion be,
As long as life endures.
The earth shall soon dissolve like snow,
The sun forbear to shine;
But God, who called me here below,
Will be for ever mine.
When we’ve been there ten thousand years,
Bright shining as the sun,
We’ve no less days to sing God’s praise
Than when we first begun.
— John Newton
